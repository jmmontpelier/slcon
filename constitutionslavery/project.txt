But lurking underneath, and behind, and throughout all of these debates was a larger and more profound controversy over what might be called the “soul” of the Constitution. These questions are highlighted, right.  This controversy began almost as soon as the Constitution made its appearance on the public stage, but the earliest expressions of it were casual and primitive statements when compared to the sophisticated theories that would later be developed. These theories about the Constitution and slavery peeked during the antebellum years, and they continue to be advanced to this day.

In the North, it was argued that the new Constitution favored general abolition. During the debates in the Massachusetts Ratifying Convention, Thomas Dawes argued that the Framers of the Constitution did all that was in their power to end the slave trade, and “we may say, that, although slavery is not smitten by an apoplexy, yet it has received a mortal wound, and will die of a consumption.” James Wilson, addressing an equally antislavery audience in Pennsylvania, likewise argued that the end of the slave trade in 1808 would lay “the foundation for banishing slavery out of this country; …it will produce the same kind, gradual change, which was pursued in Pennsylvania.” He went on to concede that the 20-year moratorium on the slave trade “was all that could be obtained. I am sorry it was no more.” Nonetheless, he was recorded as promising much more. Although Madison later suspected that Judge Wilson might have been misquoted, a transcript of one of his speeches includes a suggestion that the 20-year compromise meant that “the lapse of a few years, and Congress will have power to exterminate slavery from within our borders.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_89","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_89","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20151","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20176","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_90","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_90","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20230","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20255","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_169","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_169","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_209","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_209","title":"The Federal Pillars ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_170","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_170","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_139","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_139","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24172","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24204","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide15017","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Advocates of the Constitution in the North","thumbnail":"dr/Slide15017_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si15051","si15053","Text_Caption_125","Text_Caption_126","btn_previous_89","si20151","si20176","btn_next_90","si20230","si20255","Image_169","Text_Caption_209","Image_170","Button_139","si24172","si24204"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide15017"}}},{"id":"si15131","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si15133","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_39","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_39","title":"Is the Constitution Anti-Slavery, Pro-Slavery, or Neutral?

Charles Cotesworth Pinckney argued in South Carolina’s House of Representatives that the 20-year compromise did not even necessarily mean an end to the Atlantic slave trade in 1808; “it may be continued.” Like Wilson, he wished the Constitution had been even more favorable to his own region, but “we have made the best terms for the security of [slaves] it was in our power to make. We would have made better if we could; but, on the whole, I do not think them bad.” And within the single state of Virginia, the Antifederalists and Federalists were arguing on behalf of two very different interpretations of the Constitution. Patrick Henry and George Mason both argued that the Constitution should be rejected because it did not offer sufficient security for slave property. James Madison, however, argued that the Constitution should be adopted because slave property was sufficiently secure. The Fugitive Slave Clause offered “a better security than any that now exists,” and the federal government was not granted any power “to interpose with respect to the property in slaves now held by the states.” Virginia Governor Edmund Randolph, who also wanted his state to ratify the Constitution, insisted that at the Constitutional Convention “there was not a member of the Virginia delegation who had the smallest suspicion of the abolition of slavery.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_91","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_91","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20309","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20334","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_92","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_92","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20388","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20413","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_227","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_227","title":"Patrick Henry ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_205","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_205","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_208","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_208","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_157","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_157","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si26086","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si26112","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide15097","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Advocates of the Constitution in the South","thumbnail":"dr/Slide15097_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si15131","si15133","Text_Caption_127","Text_Caption_128","btn_previous_91","si20309","si20334","btn_next_92","si20388","si20413","Text_Caption_227","Image_205","Image_208","Button_157","si26086","si26112"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide15097"}}},{"id":"si15211","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_40","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_40","title":"Is the Constitution Anti-Slavery, Pro-Slavery, or Neutral?

Lincoln placed the Constitution, the Union, and the rule of law over the goal of abolishing slavery. Constitutionally, he believed that many aspects of slavery were protected. Politically, he believed that some antislavery measure that might be constitutionally permissible was nonetheless politically impossible for the immediate future. Nonetheless, he always maintained that the Constitution was, in its essence, an antislavery document. He believed that every antislavery measure that was both constitutionally permissible and politically feasible should be adopted.  Lincoln argued in his 1854 “Speech on the Repeal of the Missouri Compromise” that the concessions to slavery in the Constitution were made out of immediate necessity, yet the ultimate aim of the Constitution’s Framers was slavery’s extinction.

One powerful means for compelling abolition was by interpreting the Constitution in such a fashion that it would undermine any and every claim of the slaveholder and advance every right of the slave. In a speech that he delivered in Scotland in 1860,  Douglass tackled the question head-on: “The Constitution of the United States: Is It Pro-Slavery or Anti-Slavery?” Unlike Lincoln, who acknowledged that the Constitution offered some protections for slaveholders, Douglass refused to concede that even one part of the Constitution could be construed as pro-slavery.  Douglass saw the Constitution as a powerful tool for abolition, if it were placed in the right hands.

Spooner was an abolitionist, a legal theorist, and an anarchist. In 1845 he wrote a book titled, The Unconstitutionality of Slavery. In it, Spooner advocated for some stable rule of interpreting legal texts, since words are capable of innumerable different meanings. He found that rule in natural law: a “universal principle of moral obligation,” which, arising out of human nature, “is consequently as unalterable as the nature of men.” This rule of interpretation was simple and elegant and plain to all rational people: “If the legislation be consistent with natural justice, and the natural or intrinsic obligation of the contract of government, it is obligatory; if not, not.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_161","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_161","title":"In order to establish that the laws upholding slavery were unconstitutional, Spooner adopted a principle articulated by John Marshall in United States v. Fisher, but used it to a more extreme effect. Whenever laws seem to infringe upon rights, Marshall had written, “the legislative intention must be expressed with irresistible clearness, to induce a court of justice to suppose a design to effect such objects.”  Therefore, Spooner concluded that the Constitution cannot be said to sanction slavery, because it never even acknowledges it openly. A stranger reading the Constitution for the first time would not know that any provisions had a reference to slavery. Furthermore, the passages in the Constitution that allegedly referred to slavery all use the word “persons” to refer to the enslaved population. Since slaves are “persons,” then they make up a part of “We, the People,” and are therefore a part of the constitutional compact—they must not have consented to their own enslavement, for no rational person would do that. In essence, constitutional interpretation for Spooner was tantamount to being guided by no law but the moral one.

Alexander H. Stephens, the vice president of the Confederacy, articulated this view in his “Corner Stone” speech, delivered in 1861. The problem with the United States Constitution, according to him, was not found in any particular provision—some of which did protect slavery. The problem with the old Constitution was that it was written at a time when most people believed that slavery was wrong.   In his opinion of constitutional interpretation, the vice president of the Confederacy therefore agreed with Lincoln. The Constitution was written by men who abhorred slavery and hoped and expected that it would one day disappear. Not surprisingly, Lincoln saw this feature as the glory of the Constitution whereas Stephens regarded it as the Constitution’s fundamental error and the reason why it needed to be replaced with a new one.  Lincoln and Stephens therefore agreed that the Constitution was essentially an antislavery document. But whereas Lincoln saw that as a reason why slavery must be restricted wherever possible, Stephens saw it as a reason why the South must reject the Constitution.

In some ways, those who argued that the Constitution created a neutral playing field were accurately describing at least one facet of the way that the plan of government had in fact developed. It is true that some of the Framers were deliberately trying to arrange the legislative branch so that it would grant balanced power between the two regions—that it would grant each region the power of self-protection. During the debate over the initial allocation of House seats in the First Congress, Madison said that he would rather have two additional seats given to the Southern states—one to North Carolina and one to South Carolina”—rather than a single additional seat to his own state of Virginia. He preferred this addition because he had “always conceived that the ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_141","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_141","title":"difference of interest in the United States lay … [between] the Northern and Southern states.” Evidently, two additional seats given elsewhere in the South would benefit Virginia more than one additional seat for herself.  Within the Convention James Madison nonetheless recognized that the Constitution initially gave the preponderance of power to the North, and he could only hope that future population growth would mean that “every day would tend towards an equilibrium” between North and South. Privately, Madison revealed that there was an expectation in the South of more than parity; he spoke of the “expected superiority” of that region. And others also expressed their hopes based on their perceptions of regional interest as well as their attitudes toward the Constitution. George Mason expressed Southern optimism early in the Convention, when he was in favor of the Constitution: “As soon as the southern and western population should predominate, which must happen in a few years…” Yet he became pessimistic when he was opposed to the Constitution: “The Southern States are the minority in both Houses. Is it to be expected that they will deliver themselves bound hand & foot in the Eastern States[?]” The 1787 Constitution had given a small edge to the Northern states over the Southern, but it was expected that population shifts would ultimately benefit the South.

Indeed, he then urged a more Lincolnian argument—that the Constitution could not be understood without reference to those principles.   (Click to see the argument made by Adams in front of the Supreme Court.)  Adams’ ingenious argument was that the Constitution recognizes slaves only as persons, and the Declaration of Independence proclaims that every person is endowed with certain rights. Together, the two documents offered a compelling case for the presumption of freedom. Whether Adams’ interpretation of the Constitution really underwent a revolution, or whether he was adopting his constitutional position opportunistically, in each case justifying his current political or legal position, is almost immaterial. No matter who was espousing a particular constitutional “stance” with regards to slavery, that stance always seemed to conform to the individual’s political aims. If Adams’ political positions altered (and it is true that he became more vocally antislavery in his latter years), it should come as no surprise that his constitutional position should move in tandem. And Adams was not the only one questioning the relevance of the Declaration of Independence to the Constitution. Several other people were contemplating the same question, and coming up with different answers.
