When James Madison was first contemplating the best means of adopting a new constitution, he deliberately chose a form of popular ratification: a ratification by delegates who were popularly elected for that purpose only. One of the reasons he gave for this onerous process was that it would preclude any possibility of future dissolution. In a speech in the Constitutional Convention, he explained that the old Articles of Confederation had been ratified by state legislatures, which had made it only a sort of league or treaty rather than a true political compact. One problem with that sort of union was that treaties could easily be broken by the violation of just one member (see right).

What he wished to avoid in the future for the Constitution was what the delegates were in fact facing under the Articles in 1787: the dissolution of the confederation because some states refused to comply with its requirements.

A confederation, such as the old Articles of Confederation, merely binds the individual states for “no longer than during the good pleasure of each.” A Constitution that has been ordained and established by “the people,” on the other hand, “is a permanent form of government where the powers once given are irrevocable and cannot be resumed or withdrawn at pleasure.” A political compact like the United States Constitution was seen as similar to the social contract described by Locke: Once it was formed there was no going back. Americans could later alter the terms through the amendment process or they could abolish the government through revolution, but they could not peaceably cut it to pieces.  It is not at all clear that the majority of Americans who adopted the Constitution saw the nature of the compact in the same way that the Father of the Constitution did. It is certain that they viewed the choice of ratification as a momentous and solemn act (which is why the Antifederalists fought so hard to keep it from happening). It is equally clear, however, that many individual members of that compact, right from the start, began asserting a right to depart from the Union whenever they came to regret its terms.

Josiah Quincy argued that the proposed power to annex states from new territories—territories that had never even been contemplated by the Framers of the Constitution—was “a manifest and atrocious usurpation of power; of a nature dissolving, according to undeniable principles of moral law, the obligations of our national compact, and leading to all the awful consequences which flow from such a state of things.” At this time, the New England Federalists were feeling overwhelmed by the predominance of the Republican Party, which was primarily rooted in the South. The addition of more Southern states, they believed, would render them a permanent minority within the Union—a position they found intolerable.  The embargo of 1807 and the War of 1812 agitated more Northeastern secessionist fervor. New England opponents to the war seriously considered a rupture with the rest of the country in order to negotiate a separate peace deal with Britain. Rumors were rife that the Hartford Convention of 1814 would call for secession, but the moderates prevailed and ultimately stepped back from the brink. The peace treaty that followed shortly thereafter put an end to the grievances in New England, so for a time it put an end to talk of secession.

Briefly, the doctrine of nullification presumed that the individual states had the authority to nullify, or declare void, any federal act that encroached on its legitimate authority. This doctrine was developed most forcefully during the Nullification Crisis early in the 1830s. Protective tariffs had long been a grievance to the Southern states, especially to South Carolina, the largest cotton-exporting state. Frequently, these tariffs were passed in Congress by slim majorities along sectional lines, and the 1828 “Tariff of Abominations” proved to be too much for South Carolina. In 1832, John C. Calhoun resigned his position as vice president in order to champion his state’s resistance to tariffs from the Senate.  It is one of the Constitution’s ironies that the Deep South had originally given up an effective veto over tariffs in order to continue the slave trade for 20 years. In the 20-year compromise, South Carolina and Georgia had relented on a constitutional provision that would have required a two-thirds majority to pass navigation acts, and they had traded away that protection in exchange for 20 more years of the slave trade. By 1832, the Atlantic slave trade was long gone (and not missed by any state), but the Deep South was by then feeling victimized by the ability of Northern states to pass tariffs by a simple majority.

If such an amendment passed, the state seeking nullification could then decide whether to remain in the Union under the offending law.

In reality, the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions had stopped short of asserting that the states had the right to nullify federal legislation. Jefferson, in the first flush of his outrage over the Alien and Sedition Acts, had wanted to include the doctrine of nullification in his Kentucky Resolutions; in fact, he even wanted to threaten secession. Cooler heads had saved his reputation from such rash measures. Madison persuaded him to drop any mention of secession, and Kentucky’s legislature had removed the fatal word “nullification” before passing Jefferson’s original Resolutions.

To avert the immediate crisis, Congress passed a compromise tariff that mollified South Carolina, but the theoretical question over nullification was never finally resolved.  Indeed, Madison had become so alarmed by the drift of the states toward the end of his life that had the last composition he wrote for publication before his death, his “Advice to my Country,” was a plea for union.

He had become convinced by his own rhetoric that the United States Constitution provided slavery with indispensable safeguards. According to this logic, if the North’s protections were withheld, the institution of slavery would simply wither away in the South. By 1844, however, he was advocating disunion for the sake of achieving moral purity in the North, evincing less concern for the effects it would have on slavery in the South. Garrison opposed any form of civic participation in the United States, including voting, viewing it as a form of complicity with slaveholders.

The Movement threatened secession if its demands were not met. The sectional crisis of 1848-1852 formed shortly thereafter, primarily over the issue of admitting new states into the Union. Once again, Calhoun took his fight to the floor of the Senate, this time defending secession as a necessary protection for political minorities. In the wake of the compromise measures of 1850, South Carolina hosted a convention in April of 1852 to consider its response. The Convention passed two resolutions: one declaring that the state had good reason to secede and the other declaring that it had every right to secede. As South Carolinians later explained in their 1860 Declaration of Causes for Secession, the 1852 Convention ultimately chose not to exercise its right, but only from “deference to the opinions and wishes of the other slaveholding States.” But between 1852 and 1860, “these encroachments have continued to increase, and further forbearance ceases to be virtue.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_85","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_85","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17482","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17507","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_86","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_86","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17561","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17586","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_188","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_188","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide15694","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Increasing Clamors for Secession from South Carolina","thumbnail":"dr/Slide15694_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si15728","si15730","Text_Caption_141","Text_Caption_142","btn_previous_85","si17482","si17507","btn_next_86","si17561","si17586","Image_188"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide15694"}}},{"id":"si15859","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_47","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_47","title":"The Growing States’ Rights Movement ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_33","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_33","title":"Reasons for the Final Divorce ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_145","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_145","title":"Warnings of Economic Ruin ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_146","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_146","title":"Prior to 1860, South Carolina was unable to win much support from the other states when it urged disunion.

The Democratic Party was in such disarray that there was no hope for a strong showing behind any of Lincoln’s challengers. As a consequence, the Southern states had time to consider how they should respond to the prospects of a Lincoln administration.

Without naming any specific threat from the new administration, the alarmist rhetoric of the day warned of economic ruin, an end to the South’s traditional way of life, and, of course, an end to slavery. It is today estimated that about 44% of the South’s wealth was derived from the men, women, and children who were held in bondage. By way of comparison, all the land and other real estate in the South only amounted to about 25% of their wealth. Many Southerners were now convinced that the federal government would somehow act to demolish their economies, to say nothing of their way of life. There was hardly any uniform consensus on disunion, but the movement was now widespread. South Carolina had for years been sounding the alarm and issuing dire prognostications of Northern aggressions on Southern interests. They were only now getting a serious hearing from some of the other states in the Deep South. The border States, however, still maintained a wait-and-see attitude.

(Click on the image, left, to read South Carolina’s Ordinance of Secession.) South Carolina’s General Assembly had started the process immediately after they learned of Lincoln’s election, but the process was completed well before his inauguration.  After South Carolina, the other states followed in quick succession, seven of them seceding before Lincoln’s inauguration. Alabama’s ordinance made plain that the offence precipitating the divorce was the election of a Republican president and vice president—”a sectional party avowedly hostile to the domestic institutions and peace and security of the people of the State of Alabama.” That election, following upon other alleged constitutional infractions by the “Northern section, is a political wrong of so insulting and menacing a character as to justify the people of the State of Alabama” in their choice to secede. Over the next 18 months a total of eleven states had passed Ordinances of Secession. While many of the Ordinances were created in special state conventions, three states (Texas, Virginia, and Tennessee) offered their secessionist proposals as a popular referendum, and the people of these states voted for them overwhelmingly—two or three secessionists voting for every no vote.  Many of the states spoke of “resuming” the sovereign and independent status they had enjoyed prior to the Constitution. For five of the states, this made logical sense. The other six Southern states, however, had been created by Congress out of United States territory, so they never had an autonomous political existence.

It even repeated some of the language of the Declaration of Independence; in particular, they appealed to “the right of the people to alter or abolish” their government when it “becomes destructive of the ends for which it was esetablished.” But no state repeated the Declaration’s assertion that all men were created equal. Indeed, by defending its right to hold slaves, the South Carolina Declaration implicitly assumed an inequality among people at the same time that it asserted the equality of all states. South Carolina was now demanding “her separate and equal place among nations.” The Declaration of Secession from Texas made the new doctrine even more plain: “That in this free government all white men are and of right out to be entitled to equal civil and political rights.” The South had definitively rejected the principles found in the Declaration of Independence—what Lincoln had called, “the sheet anchor of American republicanism.” And with that rejection, they had removed any compelling rationale for the eventual abolition of slavery.
