of grievances” found in the 1st Amendment, was not formally adopted into the Constitution until the Bill of Rights was ratified on December 15, 1791. Nonetheless, Congress recognized the right and began receiving petitions from the start. Among the earliest petitions to arrive, in February of 1790, were three separate antislavery appeals from abolitionist groups. Prior to the adoption of the Constitution, abolition attempts, primarily from Quakers, had mostly been local affairs; they focused on the actions of statement governments. Nevertheless, the 1790 petitions were not the Quakers’ first foray into national politics. Quakers had tried petitioning the Confederation Congress to put an end to the slave trade as early as 1783. But in response to their petition, Congress merely drafted a tepid proposal—that they “recommend” to the state legislatures that the ban on the slave trade passed in 1774 was revived—and   ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_117","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_117","title":"even that noncommittal response was killed by opponents from the Deep South. The Confederation Congress was simply too weak to be any help to antislavery efforts. It lacked the power to do anything about the international commerce in slaves; it lacked the power to regulate any commerce whatsoever.  The Constitution that replaced the Articles of Confederation was therefore a theoretical game-changer for antislavery efforts. When the new Constitution was first debated during the Ratification period, some individual Quakers had initially expressed deep disappointment that the Framers had not provided for an immediate ban on the international slave trade. A few also decried the Fugitive Slave Law, since they had held out hopes that the state of Massachusetts, on particular, might become an asylum for runaway slaves from the South. Yet, in spite of some initial disappointment, many abolitionists quickly saw the new Constitution as a potential vehicle for more sweeping change than could ever be achieved under the Articles, and Quakers in Philadelphia openly advocated for its ratification. For better or for worse, the Constitution would truly nationalize the debate over slavery for the first time. And the resulting class would reveal in a very vivid and public way, also for the first time, just how differently members from various regions viewed the issue.

But the constitutional restraints described in their report were no greater than what had already been evident from a plain reading of the Constitution or from a familiarity with the ratification debates. In 1790, more people were focused on the ways that congressional powers could be used to further antislavery ends, and many Quaker petitioners felt that they had reason to be heartened that Congress had expressed a willingness to pursue some of these measures.

The Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of Quakers, which represented Pennsylvania and several surrounding states, drafted one, and John Laurence, representing a Quaker group in New York, drafted the other. These two petitions clearly focused on the narrow topic of restricting the international slave trade. While recognizing that the Constitution had placed restraints on that power—especially the power to prohibit the slave trade into the United States prior to 1808—they requested that Congress exert what powers they possessed to the utmost.  The following day, however, another petition arrived in Congress from the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. This petition as more noteworthy than the previous two for two reasons. First, it had been signed by Benjamin Franklin, one of the most eminent men in America; and second, its aims appeared to be suggesting that the Constitution’s Preamble had given Congress extensive powers to act: “Your Memorialists…have observed with great Satisfaction, that many important & salutary Powers are vested in you for ‘promoting the Welfare & securing the blessings of liberty to the people of the United States.’” The petitioners asked that Congress “Step to the very verge of the Powers vested in you for discouraging” the slave trade. But even more alarming to the Southern members, they also entreated that Congress would “countenance the Restoration of liberty to those unhappy men.” Was the Pennsylvania Abolition Society calling for a general abolition throughout the United States? Just how much power did they believe the new Congress had been given under the recently ratified Constitution?

William Smith of South Carolina argued that the petition from the Pennsylvania Abolition Society sought “in express terms for an emancipation of slaves.” Since the Constitution gave no such power to the federal government, he said, the petitioners were asking something of Congress that was clearly unconstitutional. Members from the Deep South were using this claim—that the petitioners were asking for something unconstitutional—as a reason for dismissing them without further notice.  The congressmen who defended the petitioners, however, consistently argued that the petitions did not seek an emancipation of slaves or for anything else that violated the Constitution. Elias Bourdinot of New Jersey refuted Smith’s claim: “The language is, that Congress would go to ‘the very verge of the Constitution’ to accomplish this business; but there is no request to exceed it.” John Paige of Virginia said that the Quakers “do not apply for the total abolition of slavery. They only request that such measures may be taken, consistent with the Constitution, as may finally issue in the total abolition of the slave trade” (emphasis added). Thomas Scott of Pennsylvania repeatedly maintained that Congress had no power to free the slaves already in the states, yet he wanted the petitioners listening in the gallery to know “that there is at least one member on this floor who believes that Congress have ample powers to do all they have asked respecting the African slave trade.” And John Vining of Delaware took the trouble to actually read the entire memorial presented by the Pennsylvania Abolition Society on the floor of Congress. He asked his colleagues “if there is a syllabus in this memorial which tends to emancipate the southern Negroes, or to divest a particle of property: if there is, I confess I do not understand it.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_81","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_81","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17805","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17830","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_82","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_82","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17884","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17909","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_169","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_169","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_180","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_180","title":"Elias Boudinot (NJ) ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_170","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_170","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_181","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_181","title":"John Paige (VA) ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_171","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_171","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_182","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_182","title":"John Vining (DE) ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_172","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_172","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_173","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_173","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_174","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_174","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_116","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_116","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20989","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si21021","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_117","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_117","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si21077","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si21103","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_118","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_118","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si21159","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si21185","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide15033","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Read on the Floor of Congress","thumbnail":"dr/Slide15033_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si15067","si15069","Text_Caption_123","btn_previous_81","si17805","si17830","btn_next_82","si17884","si17909","Image_169","Text_Caption_180","Image_170","Text_Caption_181","Image_171","Text_Caption_182","Image_172","Image_173","Image_174","Button_116","si20989","si21021","Button_117","si21077","si21103","Button_118","si21159","si21185"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide15033"}}},{"id":"si15147","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_40","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_40","title":"The First Antislavery Petitions to Congress ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_26","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_26","title":"The Goals of the Abolitionists ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_124","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_124","title":"Protection of Freed Persons ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_125","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_125","title":"The Quakers who crowded into the galleries of Congress to listen to the debates did not seem to dispute this interpretation of their petitions.

So could not Congress intervene when slaves had been freed according to state law and then reenslaved? If these limited aims were the extent of the petitioners’ requests, then they were asking for something that was within the scope of power given to the new government (at least it might be exercised by the new federal courts, if not the new Congress).

The day that the first two petitions were delivered, the members from South Carolina and Georgia immediately tried to stifle them. They wished to table the petitions, claiming that any actions to limit the slave trade would only give encouragement to those who were trying to abolish slavery altogether. Madison answered that the general public would pay little notice to the petitions if they were treated in the ordinary fashion, but it was the overheated reaction of the Deep South that would draw the public’s attention to them. Congressmen who were sympathetic to the abolitionists’ cause suggested submitting these petitions to a committee, so that its members could make a report on them. When the more expansively worded petition from the Pennsylvania Abolition Society arrived on February 12, the debates became even more inflamed than the day before.  Representatives from the Deep South noisily tried to silence the matter. They contended that the petitioners were asking for something unconstitutional—an abolition of slavery or an end to the slave trade prior to 1808—in which case it would be improper to send the petitions to a special committee. The debates quickly turned personal, with the members from the Deep South accusing the Quakers of being pests who had no business in meddling in an issue that did not directly affect them.

It said: “That Congress, by a fair construction of the Constitution, are equally restrained from interfering in the emancipation of slaves who already are, or who may, within the period mentioned, be imported into or born within any of the said States” (emphasis added).

Burke compared the Quakers to “Milton’s Lucifer, who entered Paradise in the shape of a cormorant.” According to Pemberton, “Burke threatened if any of the Quakers came into South Carolina to sow their sedition, … he would promote a law for their being hanged.”    The defenders of slavery made it clear that the institution was a permanent part of the Southern way of life—it was “ingrafted” into their system, according to Smith—and there was nothing that the federal government could do about it within the constraints of the Constitution.

Congress would not give up its power to regulate just because, through misconstruction, it could be used as a power to prohibit.  With slight revisions, Congress chose to keep the fifth resolution on regulating the slave trade prior to 1808, and it also retained the sixth resolution, empowering Congress to prohibit foreign slave traders from using American ports to fit out their vessels. These seemingly small resolutions were important victories for the antislavery petitioners, and they were passed in the face of strong opposition from the Deep South. The seventh resolution, however—the one that would assure the petitioners that Congress would exercise its powers, as far as they extend, “for the humane objects of the memorialists”—was dropped.

Burke and Smith thought that the move was tantamount to “heaving out an anchor to windward,” meaning that the proponents of the report were making provision for the future: they wanted to hold the resolutions in reserve, to act upon them whenever it became more convenient to do so.

Many congressmen were heartily sick of the debates and simply wanted them to end, but there were still enough supporters of the report to prevent its death in the Senate.  Madison’s opinions about the petitions changed over the course of the debates.  At the outset, he was in favor of treating them in a calm and regular fashion so that “no notice would be taken it out of doors.”  Now, in spite of serious opposition from Northern and Southern members alike, he joined the call to have both reports entered into the journals.  He had initially tried to avoid a battle, but once the battle had been engaged, he thought it was important that the public know the outcome.

Certain procedural and constitutional principles had prevailed in the House in spite of the best efforts of the Deep South to stymie them. (Click on the image, right, to explore the this process.)  At every turn the Deep South was foiled.

He believed that the Deep South was hurting its own cause in the long run. Their “mistaken zeal…against the most distant approach of danger” was causing so much disgust in the “patrons of Humanity & freedom” that it would actually hasten the very emancipation which they dreaded. Madison apparently concluded that tempers had been particularly hot during that session of Congress, and he expected that they would cool in time. When abolitionist John Parrish approached him a few months after these debates, asking that he once again interpose on their behalf, he replied that, in his opinion, “future opportunities cannot be more” unfavorable than the present moment, “and will probably be less so.” Madison urged the Quakers to be patient and wait for a more propitious opening.  Madison was largely mistaken if one considers the long view. Abolitionist petitioners would meet with additional successes at curbing the slave trade in the ensuing two decades. But the violent intransigence that the Deep South displayed in 1790 was just a foretaste of what was to come. Their belligerence would make Congress increasingly unwilling to broach the subject at all. During the 19th century, as antislavery petitioners and pro-slavery Southerners both became more obdurate, Congress temporarily issued a “gag rule”—automatically tabling all antislavery petitions without the benefit of a hearing.

Finally, in March of 1794, Congress passed the Foreign Slave Trade Act. This law made it illegal for both American citizens and foreigners to use American ports to fit out vessels “for the purpose of carrying on any trade or traffic in slaves, to any foreign country.” It was probably no coincidence that Congress established a Navy that same month for the express purpose of protecting American merchant ships from being captured, and their crews enslaved, by Algerian pirates. Americans could not plausibly object to the cruel barbarism they suffered at the hands of corsairs while American slave ships were engaged in precisely the same business. The 1794 ban on the foreign slave trade was an important win for the abolitionists, since far more American slave traders were engaged in supplying foreign ports than American ones.  Sadly, the 1794 law was ill-enforced and routinely flouted. Indeed, it has never been easy to assess the outcome of American’s first national debates over the future of slavery. When measured against the enormity of the evil that existed at the time, the reports of 1790 and their aftermath seem like a series of paltry victories, if not outright defeats. Seen from the context of the time, however, the abolitionists recognized that the new Constitution had enabled them to accomplish far more than had ever been possible under the Articles of Confederation. The debates of 1790 had looked to them like a step in the right direction.
