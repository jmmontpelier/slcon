Among the most common ideas that were foreign to the original Constitution but injected into it by later interpreters were the notions of racial superiority and the principles found in the Declaration of Independence. By injecting the old Constitution with new meaning, political actors of the day could either degrade the Constitution, rendering it into a far more sordid compact than it had been before, or they could elevate it into a document that contained within itself America’s most lofty idealism.

The truth is, the Constitution never made any reference to race until the 15th Amendment (which prohibits states from denying suffrage on the basis of race). Nonetheless, many political actors in the first half of the 19th century, especially Southerners, found ways to inject race and racism into the “authentic meaning” of the Constitution.  When Jefferson Davis left the Senate in 1861 to take up his new position as president of the Confederacy, he gave a farewell address that expressed his conviction that the United States had departed from the principles on which it was founded. The Framers of the Constitution, like those who had adopted the Declaration of Independence, had never imagined that the African race could form any part of the Union except as slaves.

The Constitution does not in fact apply the three-fifths ratio to a partial race; it applies it to “all other persons” who are not free or indentured servants (in other words, it applies to slaves). Free black persons have always counted the same as free white persons. Even more important, the purpose of the three-fifths ratio had never meant to suggest an inferiority of the person being counted; it was intended rather to diminish the political weight of the slave owner. But no matter. In the pursuit of constitutional interpretations that were friendly to one’s own position, partisan expositors did not look to the text or to the history of the Constitution. Instead, in Davis’ case, he used his own racist theories as a gloss on the words of the Constitution.

They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the ‘storm came and the wind blew.’” The new constitution of the Confederacy was meant to correct that defect. Under the new government, “all of the white race, however high or low, rich or poor, are equal in the eye of the law. Not so with the negro. Subordination in his place.” Davis’ criticism of the Constitution came after the Union had been dissolved. For those who wanted to protect slavery and preserve the union, the preferred interpretation was to assume that the Constitution upheld their views on racial superiority.

Sandford. Taney had to decide whether the plaintive in the case, Dred Scott, was a citizen of the United States at the time he sued for his freedom. If Scott was not a U.S. citizen, then he would have no standing to bring a case before any federal court, and the case would be dismissed. Taney thus reduced the whole case to this question: “The only matter in issue before the court, therefore, is, whether the descendants of such slaves, when they shall be emancipated, or who are born of parents who had become free before their birth, are citizens of a State, in the sense in which the word citizen is used in the Constitution of the United States.” (What did Taney decide? Click the image, right, to see his decision.)  Taney was at liberty to develop his own theories on race and citizenship because the Constitution was woefully silent on these question. In several places, the Constitution refers to a “citizen of the United States” as well as “citizens of different states,” but the Framers had neither defined what these terms meant nor given any indication how these terms should be defined in the future. Congress was given the exclusive power to determine how to naturalize foreign-born citizens. But who was the “natural born citizen” (those, for instance, who would be eligible to be present, according to Article II)? In practice, the states had defined for themselves who were citizens and who were not. Taney was now saying that this decentralized solution was insufficient. There must be a single definition of U.S. citizenship that applied to all the states, and that definition must take into account racial differences.

The unhappy black race were separated from the white by indelible marks, and laws long before established, and were never thought of or spoken of except as property, and when the claims of the owner or the profit of the trader were supposed to need protection. (emphasis added)  Taney was forced to acknowledge that slavery was then a dying institution in some of the Northern states, but he insisted that “this change had not be produced by any change of opinion in relation to this race” in those states; instead, it was entirely owing to the differences in climate and economies. According to Taney, residents of the Northern states were no more opposed to slavery than those from the Deep South.

He said that “these two provisions show, conclusively, that neither the description of persons therein referred to, nor their descendants, were embraced in any of the other provisions of the Constitution,” those which conferred rights on citizens. Of course, neither of those clauses had made any reference to race, still less did they make clear that there must always be a racial distinction upheld by the Constitution. But Taney was hoping to settle the racial question once and for all, and he therefore read a racial distinction into the Constitution.  The Chief Justice crowned his revisions of history with the claim that certain abolitionist beliefs—about the wrongness of slavery, and about natural rights belonging to all people, to black as well as to white—were unknown at the time the Constitution was ratified. He claimed that these beliefs had developed in America since that time, and they were therefore irrelevant to the meaning of the Constitution. “It is difficult at this day,” he said,” to realize the state of public opinion in relation to that unfortunate race, which prevailed in the civilized and enlightened portions of the world at the time … the Constitution of the United States was framed and adopted.” Taney acknowledged that some people in his own day believed that certain constitutional provisions regarded slavery as “unjust,” and he attributed those sentiments to a “change in public opinion or feeling.” But he insisted that the Court could not “give to the words of the Constitution a more liberal construction” than the Framers had given to it.

In Taney’s words, that would “put it in the power of a single State to make him a citizen of the United States, and endue him with the full rights of citizenship in every other State without their consent.” Taney probably hoped that the urgent necessity of avoiding such a calamity would atone for the strained historical and constitutional reasoning he offered in support of his conclusion: people of African descent must never been acknowledged as citizens of the United States.

Their choice to extend “all privileges and immunities” to the “free inhabitants of each of these states” was a conscious decision not to discriminate between the races. Therefore “at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, free colored persons of African descent might be, and, by reason of their citizenship in certain States, were, entitled to the privileges and immunities of general citizenship of the United States.” Curtis then conjectured that the Framers of the Constitution were familiar with the history and language of the Articles, and if they had wanted the corresponding clause in the Constitution to exclude free persons of color, then the would have made their intentions plain. They did not; therefore, the Privileges and Immunities Clause applied to all citizens, regardless of color.

He took issue with Taney’s assumption “that the public estimate of the black man is more favorable now than it was in the days of the Revolution. This assumption is a mistake.” Lincoln said that the change in public opinion in America was “decidedly the other way; and their ultimately destiny has never appeared so hopeless as in the last three or four years.” Lincoln then described the greater restrictions on citizenship rights in the Northern states and the increased obstacles to emancipation in the Southern states; all of these changes had taken place since the Revolution. He concluded:   It is grossly incorrect to say or assume, that the public estimate of the negro is more favorable now than it was at the origin of the government.

Americans have never ceased to venerate Independence Day and the document that started it all. Lincoln began his 1863 Gettysburg Address with the famous words: “Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation…” According to Lincoln’s reckoning, the nation was brought forth in 1776, when the Declaration of Independence was adopted, not with the adoption of the Constitution.  Southerners had long recognized the potential danger that these principles posed to their way of life, and thus sought to keep some distance between those principles and the Constitution. As the states became ever more divided over the issue of slavery, antislavery spokesmen increasingly sought to interpret the Constitution in light of the Declaration. Southerners—and those Northerners who wanted to avoid conflict—responded to this peril in different ways. Those who wanted to preserve the Union either sought to reinterpret the Declaration of Independence or to reject its principles outright. Those who had given up on the Union admitted the constitutional relevance of the Declaration of Independence, and they acknowledged its original meaning, but for those reasons they sought to reject the Constitution. No one seriously believed that Americans could proclaim that, literally, “all men are created equal” while simultaneously defending the perpetuation of slavery.

If those who framed the Declaration “could rise from their graves,” he said, “they could not at all recognize it.” Lincoln did not shrink from the charge of hypocrisy against the signers of the Declaration: “They meant simply to declare the right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit.” By contrasting the Founders’ deferral of freedom to his present opponents’ unabashed defense of tyranny, Lincoln demonstrated that there are worse conditions than hypocrisy.

In a fragment he wrote, probably shortly after his election to the presidency, that he agreed with Calhoun that declaring the principle of “Liberty to all” was not necessary for asserting independence from Great Britain.

The Confederate Constitution would be the first one in the world to be based upon the “great physical, philosophical, and moral truth” that the African race was subordinate.
