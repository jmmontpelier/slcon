Constitutional Convention’s long summer’s deliberations and during the climax of the pitched battle between the large and small states—George Mason theatrically declared that “he would bury his bones in this city rather than expose his country to the consequences of a dissolution of the Convention without any thing being done.” From the earliest days of their meetings he had ardently supported replacing the Articles of Confederation with a more effective constitution, and he had been a warm admirer of his fellow colleagues. When the Convention first opened for business, he reported to this son that “America has certainly, upon this occasion, drawn forth her first characters”; he found men there “of the most respectable abilities” and “the purest intentions.” By August 31, however, Mason’s views had dramatically changed. Never one to stint on corporeal imagery, he announced “that he would sooner chop off his right hand than put it to the Constitution as it now stands.” After the Convention he reportedly called the delegates south of Virginia “a parcel of Coxcombs,” and he dismissed the delegates from New England as “Knaves and Fools.”  What had taken place in the intervening eight weeks to produce this transformation in one of the Convention’s most active participants?

But the Convention did not even consider adding a bill of rights to the Constitution until September 12; and when Mason did introduce the topic, he offered only a lackluster defense for it. It is true that he named the absence of a bill of rights among his catalogue of objections to the Constitution. But it is equally clear that, well before the idea of a bill of rights had even been mentioned in the Convention, other objects had already induced Mason to threaten self-amputation rather than acquiesce to the plan. These objections continued to rankle him on his deathbed, a year after the Bill of Rights had been added to the Constitution.

His disaffection resulted from “a Compromise between the Eastern, and the two  Southern States [South Carolina and Georgia], to permit the latter to continue the Importation of Slaves for twenty odd Years; a more favourite Object with them than the Liberty and Happiness of the People.”  The compromise to which Mason referred was one of those deals which seem specially designed to vindicate the old adage comparing law-making to sausage-making. It involved some horse-trading between New England’s interests in creating a government that could effectively control navigation acts and the Deep South’s interest in continuing the international slave trade. But although the process of the deal’s formation is ugly to witness, and it does no credit to its makers, the compromise itself was not a thoroughgoing abomination. The outcome of the 20-year compromise was far from ideal, but it was an improvement over the existing situation.

As early as 1774, the Continental Congress, like the Confederation Congress, had passed a ban, of sorts, against the slave trade. But the Continental Congress, like the Confederation Congress that followed, had no power to enforce the ban, so it was in reality no more than a statement of national goals, and it was widely ignored by the states. Absent a central government to enforce these prohibitions, limitations on the slave trade would have to come from laws or constitutional provisions passed by the state governments. And almost all of the states had voluntarily outlawed the international slave trade by 1787. But there was nothing preventing any state from reversing course if it chose. Even South Carolina had put a temporary prohibition on the importations prior to the Convention in 1787, but for economic and not anti-slavery reasons.  If even one state were left free to import, however, that condition would have continental significance. As Mason pointed out in the Convention, the prohibitions of the other states “would be in vain, if South Carolina and Georgia be at liberty to import:” they would ”fill” the western territory with slaves. For the first time, the new Constitution held out the promise that Congress could prohibit the slave trade throughout all the states by 1808. The 20-year compromise therefore changed none of the existing circumstances for the worse, and it gave hope that the situation would be changed for the better after 20 years. And this improvement was made possible only because of the moral pressures against slavery which were being exerted by certain vocal members from within the Convention, including George Mason.

From the outset and repeatedly, South Carolina and Georgia stuck to their ultimatum: their states’ preexisting “right” to import slaves would be protected by the Constitution or they would not be a party to the Constitution. And by allowing these two states to remain outside of the Union, the delegates would not be changing any of their circumstances for the better: those states would still be able to continue importing slaves indefinitely.

George Mason, who owned more slaves than nearly anyone at the Convention, nonetheless reviled the institution and had been a zealous opponent of the slave trade for decades. His scathing attack at the Convention surpassed even Gouverneur Morris’ invective. First, he blamed the British for originating “this infernal traffic,” and he warned that unless they could put a stop to it, the Western Territories would be filled with slaves. He named various reasons why slavery should be suppressed as much as possible: “Slavery discourages arts and manufactures. They produce the most pernicious effect on manners. Every master of slaves is born a petty tyrant.” And if that were not enough, slavery invited the wrath of God. Mason even directed some of his polemic against New England shipping interests: he “lamented that some of our eastern brethren had, from a lust of gain, embarked in this  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_129","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_129","title":"nefarious traffic.” Mason recognized that the Southern states had always possessed the power to decide this question for themselves in the past, but as “was the case with many other rights,” the right to import slaves must now “be properly given up. He held it essential, in every point of view, that the general government should have power to prevent the increase of slavery.”  Ellsworth must have resented Mason’s “lust for gain” crack, which had been aimed at the Northeastern states, because he immediately shot back to Mason that since he (Ellsworth) “had never owned a slave, [he] could not judge of the effects of slavery on character.” He then proceeded to offer a defense of the international slave trade that was more chillingly merciless (and honest) than anything uttered by a Southerner: “As slaves also multiply so fast in Virginia and Maryland, that it is cheaper to raise than import them, whilst in the sickly rice swamps foreign supplies are necessary, if we go no further than is urged, we shall be unjust towards South Carolina and Georgia.” In other words, Ellsworth was arguing that, since the plantation conditions were so unhealthy in the Deep South that their slaves die young, it would be “unjust” not to allow these states to replenish them with fresh supplies from Africa.

Her slaves will rise in value, and she has more than she wants.” What General Pinckney had merely implied at the Constitutional Convention he later spelled out more plainly to South Carolina’s legislature: he believed that the Virginians’ stance on the slave trade was “interested and inconsistent,” because they pretended to adopt a moral stance against the international slave trade while really hoping to profit from its discontinuance. During the ratification debates in Virginia, Madison recalled this accusation from South Carolina, citing it as among the reasons why the delegates at the Constitutional Convention found it difficult to insist on an earlier end of the slave trade. More recently, historians have generally adopted Pinckney’s ad hominem attack against Virginians as if it were an obvious and uncontested fact. If one examples the lives and values of the Virginian delegates, however, the available evidence supports the proposition that they were motivated more by principle than by avarice when they argued against the slave trade.

These things may form a bargain among the Northern and Southern states.” These seemingly irrelevant issues—taxes on exports and a power over Navigation Acts—were favorite objects of the Northern states, and up to this point in the Convention they had been unable to win the assent of the Convention as a whole. The Northern states had been interested in laying taxes on exports for the purpose of raising national revenue, because they believed that such a tax would fall disproportionately on the Southern states. And the New England states that were heavily involved in shipping had also wanted Congress to be able to pass “navigation acts”—which could be used to impose tariffs or close off some markets altogether—in order to protect domestic manufactures or retaliate against the commercial policies of other countries. But most of the delegates from the Southern states had feared that this power might be used to their disadvantage, and they formed common cause with some of the smaller Northern states, with fewer shipping interests to protect, because they had initially been wary of placing any unnecessary powers in the hands of the central government. Consequently, the power to pass “navigation acts” had been excepted from the general power to regulate commerce. Congress could still pass them, but they would require a two-thirds majority in each house. This super-majority requirement would give the Southern states an effective veto over any commercial regulations unfavorable to that region. Northern states, on the other hand, were concerned that effective trade regulation would be impossible without an easier way to pass navigation acts.

So long a term will be more dishonorable to the American character than to say nothing about it in the Constitution.” Since General Pinckney and James Madison had both been on the committee that drafted this compromise, it is very likely that this exchange was a reprise of an earlier battle that had already been fought in committee, with the South Carolinian evidently believing that he had been on the losing side.

The delegates then proceeded to debate the related clause about placing duties on the imported slaves. Interestingly, those who were unified in their opposition to the slave trade were divided on this question. Sherman and Madison did not want any duties attached to the importations, because it had the effect of “acknowledging men to be property,” and they “thought it wrong to admit in the Constitution the idea that there could be property in men.” Others, however, argued that exempting slave importers form paying any duties at all would be the practical equivalent of granting them a bounty on their trade, because they would be the only traders who were exempt from paying taxes. For those who were opposed to the slave trade, the choice lay between a distasteful logical implication or an offensive practical result. The members from the Deep South only wanted to be assured that Congress could not levy such a high duty that it would be tantamount to a prohibition on the imports.

But his two colleagues from South Carolina quashed that attempt; after all, a deal is a deal, and a Southerner does not try to back out of a gentleman’s agreement. Four states (beginning with Maryland and moving southward) voted to consider Pinckney’s motion, but they were outgunned. Even South Carolina voted with all of the Northern states to preclude that restriction on commercial activity. The clause that previously required a two-thirds majority for navigation acts was then struck from the draft without further dissent.  The bargain between the Deep South and the New England states had been consummated. The final touch was added on September 10, when South Carolina insisted that the 20-year compromise must be safe from the amendment process. If their experience in the Convention had taught them anything, it was that the slave trade was so unpopular among the other states that its opponents could easily muster the three-fourths majority necessary to pass an amendment repealing the 20-year allowance for the trade. Even many of those who had been opposed to the original compromise showed a willingness to abide by the deal once it had been struck.

Since Georgia later voluntarily closed the slave trade in 1798, and South Carolina prohibited the trade from 1787 until 1803, it is uncertain how great their perceived need for slaves really was in that 20-year period. The consequences of the North’s concession are by no means trivial, however; it is estimated that almost 40,000 foreign slaves were imported into Charleston between 1803 and 1807. Nonetheless, whatever economic benefits the Deep South gained by retaining its power to import slaves would last for only 20 years. But many Southerners came to believe that, by effectively giving the power over tariffs to the Northern States, they had placed themselves at an economic disadvantage that would last for many decades. Modern economists tend to agree with them. A recent survey of economic historians that 93% believe that antebellum tariff laws benefited the Northern economy at the expense of the Southern. Protectionist tariffs were often passed along sharply regional lines in Congress: the Southern states largely voting against them but losing out to large Northern majorities. If delegates from the Deep South had held on to the security that a two-thirds majority would have given them, the South would have been in a better position to protect their economies from high tariffs that continued to be a regional grievance until the 16th Amendment made income taxes, rather than import duties, the primary source of national revenue.

Even before the deal between the Deep South and the Northeast had been finalized, the delegates from South Carolina had announced their intentions. During a consideration of the clause guaranteeing the rendition of fugitives from justice, Charles Pinckney and Pierce Butler “moved to require ‘fugitive slaves and servants to be delivered up like criminals.’” The immediate response from the states northward was that no state should be required to pay for the capture and return of other states’ slaves and servants. In response, Butler temporarily withdrew his motion in order to reconsider a revised one at a later time. Just one day later, however, and immediately after the matter of the navigation acts was settled, Butler attempted a reworded provision to the same effect. His proposal made clear that escaped slaves and servants, if they should flee to other states, would “not be discharged from such service or labor,” by the laws subsisting in any other state; instead, the escapee would “be delivered up to the person justly claiming their service or labor.” No one opposed Butler’s motion and it passed with unanimous consent.

It was also the case that most states, whether North or South, did not relish the prospect of welcoming a large population of free African Americans in their midst (regardless of how they had become free). And it is also possible that there was an unspoken understanding between the delegates at the Constitutional Convention and the congressmen who were simultaneously passing the Northwest Ordinance that summer in New York (there were even some members who were serving in both roles). There is a clause in the Northwest Ordinance that is suspiciously similar to the Constitution’s Fugitive Slave Clause; and Madison’s private secretary, Edward Coles, recalled years later that Madison had told him that both of these clauses, as well as the provision in the Northwest Ordinance forbidding slavery in that territory, were formed with a mutual reference to each other.

The Framers were very careful to word the clause so that the recognition of the property in slaves (much less the legitimacy of such a property) would not be explicitly recognized in the constitutional text. Butler’s original proposition had required that slaves must be returned to the persons who were “justly claiming their service or labour.” In the Committee of Style, any reference to the “just” claims of the slaveowner was dropped, and the clause referred instead to the slave or servant who was “legally held to service or labour.” Finally, just two days before the Convention was adjourned, “the term ‘legally’ was struck out; and the words ‘under the laws thereof,’ inserted…in compliance with the wish of some who thought the term legal equivocal, and favouring the idea that slavery was legal in a moral view.” This change of wording claimed up two potential ambiguisites (though it left behind others):   It was now clear that the Constitution did not recognize the moral “lawfulness” of slavery; and It was clear that it was not under the Constitution that men were recognized as property; rather it was under the laws of the states that men were held to service or labor.  The distinction may be rather subtle or abstruse, but at least some of the Framers had considered it imperative that the Constitution give no explicit sanction to the institution of slavery.

When put in practice, starting with federal legislation in 1793, it would also be a moral, political, and legal nightmare for the young republic. By contrast, the 20-year compromise—unlovely as it was in the making—would be an improvement over the existing circumstances. The international slave trade would be permitted for only 20 more years, and those 20 years would be no worse than the conditions existing under the Articles of Confederation. As Madison pointed out during the ratifying debates, those states which had already forbidden the slave trade could continue to forbid it under the new Constitution. And the federal government would now be empowered to outlaw the slave trade throughout the United States in 20 years, a power that they had never had before. Even the 20-year allowance of the slave trade was granted only to “the states now existing,” which meant that the new Congress could forbid slave trade into any territories or any states that were created before 1808. Congress did in fact act on every power they were granted:   They prohibited the international slave trade into: The Mississippi Territory in 1798 The Louisiana Territory in 1804 They outlawed the trade throughout the country at the earliest possible moment, going into effect on January 1, 1808.

Therefore, for those Antifederalist opponents who witnessed its formation—such as George Mason and Luther Martin—the most noxious part of the compromise was the quid pro quo demanded by the New England states. But this venal aspect of the bargain should not be allowed to totally obscure what was admirable in the debates. There were a few delegates who stood up to the intransigent members from South Carolina and Georgia and insisted that the international slave trade must finally come to an end. As General Pinckney acknowledged in the South Carolina legislature, the Deep South had been forced to yield on this question because of “the religious and political prejudices” of some of the other members. It is to the credit of men such as Morris, Mason, King, Dickinson, Langdon, and Randolph that the Constitution held out any promise that there would be an end to the further import of slaves.
