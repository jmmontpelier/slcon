Almost everybody outside of Georgia and South Carolina was disgusted by the slave trade, and many were outraged that the Constitution had allowed it to continue for 20 years. But few were in any doubt that Congress would exercise its power to ban the trade once the Constitution lifted the 20-year moratorium. In the meantime, Congress often sought those means that were within its power to suppress or mitigate the commerce before 1808.

When the Constitution was being drafted, the Deep South had ensured that a cap on import duties for this trade was specified in the Constitution, so that Congress could not tax the slave trade out of existence. Those who had wanted an early end to the slave trade, however, were divided about permitting the tax. James Madison “thought it wrong to admit in the Constitution the idea that there could be property in men,” and a tax on slaves carried with it the sure implication that slaves would be the only imports that were not taxed; such a situation would be like giving a bounty to slave dealers. From its start, then, the meaning of the $10 tax on slaves was more symbolic than policy driven.  During the First Congress, Madison sought to implement the $10 tax on slave imports. He had fought against its inclusion in the Constitution; but having lost that battle, he believed that it  was important to implement it.  In both cases, it was the implicit meaning of the tax that was more important to him than the revenue that could be generated. Madison admitted that the proposal to tax slave imports did unfortunately contain the idea that this part of “the human race [was] a species of property; but the evil does not arise from adopting the clause now proposed; it is from the importation to which it relates.” A competing idea was now even more important to him: “The dictates of humanity, the principles of the people, the national safety and happiness, and prudent policy requires it of us; the Constitution has particularly called our attention to it.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_77","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_77","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18538","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18563","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_78","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_78","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18617","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18642","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_229","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_229","title":"Ledger of Sale for Enslaved Individuals ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_209","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_209","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_212","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_212","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_158","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_158","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si25752","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si25778","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide14839","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The $10 Tax on Slave Imports","thumbnail":"dr/Slide14839_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si14873","si14875","Text_Caption_115","Text_Caption_116","btn_previous_77","si18538","si18563","btn_next_78","si18617","si18642","Text_Caption_229","Image_209","Image_212","Button_158","si25752","si25778"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide14839"}}},{"id":"si14953","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_38","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_38","title":"Suppressing and Banning the International Slave Trade ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_24","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_24","title":"The $10 Tax on Slave Imports ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_117","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_117","title":"What Changed Madison’s Mind?

Applying the $10 tax to slave imports “will be that manifestation of our sense, expected by our constituents, and demanded by justice and humanity.”  As so often happened when the subject of slavery was discussed, merely crass policy considerations and regional interests trumped symbolism.

The question of applying the $10 tax would again arise several more times over the next 20 years, and in each case, the question of symbolism was of paramount importance in the debate. There were some who still did not wish to tax slave imports because they did not want the federal government to acknowledge that slaves were a form of property and to profit from their importation. Others wanted to lay the tax because they thought it sent a national message of disapprobation. And certain members of the Deep South were opposed to the tax because they, too, came to see it as an antislavery measure, and they were opposed to any congressional action that looked like meddling in their peculiar institution.

Georgia was the only state that allowed slave imports between 1789 and 1798, and into 1798 banned the trade. In 1803, however, South Carolina reopened the trade and the question of taxing slave imports was raised once again.  Nearly everyone at least paid lip service to the evils of the slave trade. Even Thomas Lowndes of South Carolina professed in 1804 that he regretted his own state’s involvement in the commerce, and he looked forward to the day when Congress could outlaw it. He went further and adopted the traditional antislavery argument against the slave-trade tax: receiving revenue from the slave trade would seem to give congressional “sanction” to the practice. It might even make Congress less eager to put an end to the trade in 1808 after it had collected revenue from it for a number of years!  Other members, however, argued that the tax would express the government’s opposition to the trade. To counter this, one proposed tax bill explicitly stated that “nothing on this act shall be construed to give a sanction to the importation of slaves” and that it was “the true intent and design of this act to discourage” further imports. Other proposed bills contained controversial provisions, such as the one that would have liberated any slave that was imported without paying the $10 tax. Also, there were some who entertained hopes that South Carolina would repeal its slave trade law before any tax went into effect. Finally, it seemed too late in the day to adopt such a tax, for the date was drawing near when Congress could outlaw the trade entirely.

Congress had issued another one when it debated certain antislavery petitions in 1790. These debates had not led to any congressional action, but they had culminated in the Foster Report that had outlined potential actions that Congress could take to suppress the slave trade in the future. Key among these potential powers was the authority to forbid Americans from participating in the slave trade between two foreign countries and to forbid the use of American ports by foreign slave traders. These were not insignificant powers, since far more American ships were then engaged in the transfer of slaves to foreign ports than to domestic ones.  Nonetheless, Congress did not act on the promise contained within the Foster Report until 1794. Few congressmen were eager to relive the rancor that had erupted the first time the issue had been debated. However, the abolition societies were not as reticent as the politicians, and they did not let up in their lobbying efforts to sway the public and their representatives. They distributed newspaper articles that described harrowing revolts aboard slave ships, accounts that clearly sided with the Africans trying to regain their freedom. They continued sending petitions to Congress, sending letters to congressmen, and meeting with them personally. And in 1794 they formed the American Convention, a national federation of abolitionist societies, uniting the powers of several smaller abolitionist groups. The tireless lobbying of the abolitionists finally paid off that same year. Congress responded to one of their petitions by drafting the Foreign Slave Trade Act. The bill passed with strong support from both Houses and was signed into law by President Washington on March 22, 1794.

Congress’ 20-year moratorium on banning the slave trade only extended to those states “now existing” when the Constitution was formed; therefore Congress from the first had the power to ban foreign imports of slaves into any of the territories or new states. Congress exercised this power to prohibit the Atlantic slave trade into the Mississippi territory in 1798. In 1803, President Jefferson had wanted Congress to likewise prohibit any recently imported slaves from entering the newly acquired Louisiana Territory. According to his wishes, Louisiana would not be able to import their slaves either through its own ports or via any established state that might choose to reopen the slave trade (South Carolina had not yet reversed its slave trade ban).

The 1804 Orleans Governing Act not only banned foreign slave imports into the Orleans Territory (the territory that would become the state of Louisiana), but it also mandated that any slave brought there illegally would be freed. Even more remarkable, and contrary to Jefferson’s design, the bill prohibited the domestic slave market into the territory. Slaveowners could relocate with their own slaves into the area, but only if the slaves had been imported prior to 1798 (the year Georgia had banned slave imports). This measure would close off all incentives for importing African slaves into South Carolina for the sake of reselling them in Louisiana. In later years, Southerners would uniformly oppose any measure that restricted the domestic slave market, but at this early date there were several Southern congressmen who voted with the majority to cut off the slave market entirely, both foreign and domestic, at the borders of Louisiana. The House was willing to go even further, forbidding slaves from being brought into the territory even by their owners, but the Senate rejected that amendment.

The 1803 “Act to Prevent the Importation of Certain Persons” was intended to block the entry of any foreign negro, mulatto, or other person of colour”; it was designed to deny entry to former slaves from the West Indies. This law was an example of bad legislation put to good use. It was initially urged not only for racist reasons, but also because Southerners had growing fears that newly freed slaves would infect their own slaves with the urge to revolt. Importantly, however, this law gave the federal government authority to enforce state laws banning the entry of any persons of African descent. Since all states by 1803 had outlawed the Atlantic slave trade, the federal government now possessed important new powers to enforce state laws that banned the slave trade. Federal authorities could now capture slave ships bound for American ports and prosecute the perpetrators in federal courts.  For a brief period, the state laws against the Atlantic slave trade were enforced more effectively than they ever had been before. Shortly after the 1803 law was passed, James Madison, acting as Secretary of State, sent a circular letter to all American consuls and commercial agents. He acknowledged that, notwithstanding the prohibitions against the slave trade that for years had existed throughout all the states, they had experienced numerous violations. He expressed concern that the illicit slave trade might now increase following the recent return to peace. He therefore asked them “to exert a steadfast vigilance respecting all such infractions of the laws.” During a small window prior to 1808, the Atlantic slave trade was outlawed in all the states and territories and the federal government was empowered to enforce those laws.

The House immediately began reconsidering the $10 tax on slave imports, the only form of discouragement within their constitutional powers. Even that timid response was postponed, partly in expectation that South Carolina would itself make the legislation unnecessary by reversing its odious law. The expectation was not unrealistic; many of the most ardent opponents of the newly opened slave trade resided in South Carolina. And Americans were not the only ones baffled by South Carolina’s retrograde step. The abolitionists in Great Britain also became discouraged by reports that the slave trade was again booming in Charleston, and William Wilbeforce pressed American’s minister, James Monroe, for an explanation.  South Carolina’s reversal had devastating consequences. The years between 1803 and 1808 saw an unprecedented rise in the American participation in the slave trade. Modern estimates of the exact number of slaves imported into South Carolina during these five years vary widely, but it was certainly in the tens of thousands. Many experts put the number at about 50,000. A large percentage of this human cargo ended up in other states and territories, and likely about one-tenth of the newly arrived Africans were destined for Louisiana alone. Legalizing the slave trade in South Carolina also opened up clandestine opportunities for Americans who wanted to participate in the illegal slave trade between foreign countries.  Meanwhile, there was a growing consensus in the country—even in the Deep South—that the Atlantic slave trade  was bad for the country and wrong in itself.

In their respective efforts to end the abominable traffic, the two countries would have a mutual influence on each other that would finally culminate in an international race to be the first in the cause of liberty. America’s influence on the Mother Country, however, would not always be salutary. Several early attempts in Britain to ban their participation in the slave trade were met with the unanswerable response that the American trade rendered any English renunciation futile. If British ships ceased transporting slaves, it was argued, then other countries, especially America, would simply take up the slack (and reap the profits) that Britons chose to renounce.  The 1794 law forbidding Americans from participating in the slave trade between foreign countries had given hope to some British abolitionists that this argument would be undermined, but the American law was so poorly enforced that it did little good in swaying members of Parliament to act. Many of its members had commercial interests in the West Indies. Because the mortality rate for slaves in that part of the world was notoriously high, British plantation owners were often far more reluctant to give up the Atlantic slave trade than their American counterparts. When South Carolina reopened the slave trade in 1803, its decision further entrenched the trade not only in America but worldwide. The British did not get serious about ending their participation in the Atlantic trade until American’s constitutional 20-year moratorium was coming to a close, and they did so only after receiving assurances from Monroe that Congress would indeed act on these powers.

In 1806, news that England was finally getting serious about ending the trade prompted many Americans to attempt to clear legislative statements of intent even before they had the constitutional authority to act on their intentions. To be sure, the slave trade was so unpopular in America that Congress would undoubtedly have exercised its constitutional powers in 1808 even without reference to what was happening overseas. But England’s antislavery agitation spurred Americans to give the ban its earliest possible expression. In June of 1806, Parliament had stated their own intent on a resolution declaring that “with all convenient speed, [they would] take measures for abolishing” the trade. And in December of that same year, President Jefferson made an appeal in his State of the Union Address that the American legislature should hasten their own ban.

The position of the Southerners—who were interested in separating questions of morality from that of slavery whenever possible—received some support from the pragmatism of Northern abolitionists. There were many Northerners who feared that if the punishment for smuggling were too severe then it would be less likely to be enforced. The enforcement of any law requires the willing participation of prosecutors, judges, and juries, and there would be few of these, especially in the South, who would be willing to prosecute or convict if the punishment were death. After considering and reconsidering the death penalty at various stages, Congress finally settled that the crime would be a “high misdemeanor,” punishable with a combination of stiff fines and prison sentences.

States could take cognizance of those moral aims that were an intrinsic part of their ordinary police powers; the federal government could not. In answer to that argument, John Smilie of Pennsylvania asked, in the event that Americans began kidnapping the “unoffending inhabitants” of Turkey or Europe, whether such a transgression could only be punished under “commercial principles.” He referred his colleagues instead to “the principles of 1776” and quoted from the Declaration of Independence. After lengthy and increasingly heated debate, the final bill was framed according to the wishes of the Southerners (and some of the more circumspect Northerners): it was a commercial regulation worded in morally neutral language.

Nevertheless, they objected just as forcefully against any proposals to remove freed Africans to the Northern states or return them to Africa. It was clear that many in the South were opposed in principle to the notion that the federal government could free any African who had once been enslaved; their objects did not rest on any concrete effects that the measure would have within their states.  This point was clarified by the two Virginia senators, William Branch Giles and Richard Brent. In an 1809 letter to Governor John Tyler they explained that certain provisions in the law were framed “at the urgent solicitations of the Slave-holding States” in order to uphold a particular principle: “that the question of Bond or Free, as applied to persons when brought, as well as being within the jurisdiction of particular States, is exclusively referred for decision to the state tribunals, and not to those of the U.S., and that the constitutional jurisdiction of the U.S. ceases at the point where that of the particular States commences” (emphasis in the original).

The law gave no indication of whether or how the smuggled slaves might be sold or what was to become of the proceeds of such a sale. The only concession to humanity that the law made was this: the parties responsible for capturing the slave ship would be entitled to their half of the ship’s proceeds only if they “shall safe keep” any Africans they discovered on board.

Conservative estimates put the numbers at around one thousand per year, and many today believe that the law was actually rather effective at preventing most slave importations. All agree, however, that the number of slaves illegally imported into the United States pales against the millions of slaves that were brought into the colonies of Spain and Portugal during the same period. America’s greater failure was the continued illicit participation by some of its citizens in the trade between Africa and other parts of the New World.

Unquestionably, anticipations that America was close to passing its own law had accelerated Parliament’s good intentions. Abolitionists in both countries exchanged information regularly. The British had even made some overtures to America for mutual cooperation in suppressing the Atlantic slave trade before either country had entirely outlawed it. A treaty negotiated by James Monroe and William Pinckney in 1806 contained one provision that clearly anticipated that such laws would be passed. It pledged mutual assistance toward “the final and complete abolition of a trade so repugnant to the principles of justice and humanity.” But the main body of the treaty—which dealt with shipping rights and naval impressment—was so objectionable to President Jefferson that he refused to even send it to the Senate for consideration. Over the next several years, relations between American would grow from bad to worse, and any real cooperation between them on this or any other endeavor was impossible. The Treaty of Ghent, however, which ended the War of 1812, finally adopted a provision for mutual cooperation.

President Martin van Buren likewise asked Congress in 1839 to preserve “the integrity and honor of our flag” by revising the laws toward a more effectual suppression of the trade. President Zachary Taylor’s 1849 address to Congress sought to amend their existing laws “with a view to the effectual suppression of that barbarous traffice.”  In each case, the president drew congressional attention to the prevalence of American vessels employed in carrying slaves to foreign countries, and in each case their pleas for more effectual restraints were more forceful than the response.

As Congress initially feared, however, it would not be easy to convict a man and sentence him to the full extent under the law. Although dozens of slave traders were prosecuted under the piracy law, and several were convicted, the first to be hung for his crime was Nathaniel Gordon in 1862. Gordon was an American trader captured off the coast of Africa on his way to Cuba. Descriptions of Gordon’s treatment of his human cargo were simply horrifying, and the judge, as he sentenced the condemned man, reminded him “that you showed mercy to none,” not even to the women and children aboard his ship. Although others had been caught before who were guilty of no less horrific offenses, a Harper’s Weekly article published at the time aptly explained why a capital conviction had never been achieved before: “it seemed so absurd to hang a man for doing at sea that which, in half the Union, is done daily without censure on land.” Even in Gordon’s case, a massive petition drive was launched asking President Lincoln to commute his sentence. Lincoln wrote in response that it was his “duty to refuse.” Gordon was hung the day after he attempted suicide.

The American Navy was frequently weak, and cooperation between countries was often complex and precarious.

Yet he did not order that the Africans found aboard the ship be freed; they were instead handed over to the French authorities who were claiming jurisdiction in the case “to be dealt with according to [their] sense of duty and right.” Three years later, the strong moral stance of Story’s decision in Eugenie was significantly curtailed by Marshall’s ruling in The Antelope. In the first case, the captured Africans had been claimed by France, which was another country that had outlawed the slave trade. But in the case of The Antelope, it was Spain that claimed possession of the ship and cargo, and Spain had not outlawed the trade. The attorney defending the Africans, Francis Scott Key, claimed that Spain’s laws were not only contrary to America’s laws and the law of nations but they violated the law of nature. Chief Justice Marshall accepted only the first and last parts of that argument. The slave trade was contrary to the law of nature but not the law of nations; and the positive law, he said, was the only one applicable to the case. Most of the Africans in this case, however, were freed. But that decision was based on a narrow finding related to The Antelope, not on broad principles that could be applied to future cases. Thus, declarations of sound moral principles did not always lead to judicial rulings in favor of liberty and vice versa.

Privately, Justice Story considered his performance to be “extraordinary.” Pointing to copies of the Declaration of Independence that hung in the courtroom, Adams urged the judges to rest their judgment on “no law, statute, or constitution, no code, no treaty” but what was applicable to the current case: “the law of Nature of and of Nature’s God on which our fathers placed our own national existence.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_129","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_129","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22646","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22671","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_130","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_130","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22725","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22750","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide17833","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"La Amistad","thumbnail":"dr/Slide17833_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si17918","Text_Caption_193","Text_Caption_195","Text_Caption_196","btn_previous_129","si22646","si22671","btn_next_130","si22725","si22750"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide17833"}}},{"id":"si17972","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si17974","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_66","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_66","title":"Suppressing and Banning the International Slave Trade ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_52","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_52","title":"The Federal Courts and the International Slave Trade ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_197","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_197","title":"The Court Rules on La Amistad ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_198","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_198","title":"The Court instead hewed to the narrow legal questions of the case and steered clear of the soaring principles of natural law that had characterized the arguments from the defense. Justice Story even wrote that all the cargo would have been restored to Spain if the Africans had been “lawfully held as slaves under the laws of Spain.” Nonetheless, he wrote in his decision that American jurists had an obligation to respect the personal rights of Africans as well as the property rights of the Spaniards, and where there was an apparent conflict between the two, it “Must be decided upon the eternal principles of justice and international law.” In  a nearly-unanimous 6-to-1 decision, the Court rejected both of the irreconcilable demands being made by the Spaniards: to claim the Africans as property and to prosecute them for murder. The passengers of the Amistad, who had by this time been imprisoned for years, were at least freed and returned to Africa.  The small triumphs that were achieved during this period, such as the Amistad case, were dwarfed by the enormity of the evils being perpetrated at the time. Thirty-five passengers of the Amistad were returned to Africa against a backdrop of millions of Africans enslaved and transported in the other direction, to Central and South America.

In Hudgins, the court implicitly rejected the traditional presumption in favor of liberty of all persons, replacing it with a presumption in favor of slavery for those with African features. Whites or “copper-coloured person[s] with long jetty black, straight hair,” referring to American Indians, were presumed to be free. Accordingly, the burden always feel upon the black person to disprove the claim of an owner’s right to enslave. Such a burden was impossible for most blacks with legitimate freedom claims to meet because of the difficulty of acquiring the documentation and testimony necessary to defeat this presumption. Moreover, these blacks would be subject to the provisions of Virginia law governing lawsuits by free persons illegally held as slaves. These provisions were extremely favorable to slave owners and placed burdens inconsistent with notions of due process provided to white Virginians under the Virginia Bill of Rights.

Racial identity was a more complicated endeavor than Judge Tucker proposed. Tucker created an artificially simplistic system of categorization embraced by those seeking a simple mechanism by which to assign race and enforce slavery.
