other pressures forced him to confront it. Radical Republicans began badgering him to free the slaves. Charles Sumner argued that the war had removed all constitutional protections. The Southern people had rebelled against the government. They could not enjoy the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The government could use its war powers to eradicate the institution. Slavery had caused the war; slavery was the cornerstone of the Confederacy; it was ridiculous to fight the war and not destroy the factor that had brought it about. If Lincoln really wanted to save the Union, had to wipe out slavery and destroy the planter class.  Sumner also linked slavery and foreign policy. Throughout 1861 and 1862, England seemed about to recognize the Confederacy. If Lincoln made emancipation a war aim, Sumner told him, England could not openly aid the South. She was proud of her antislavery tradition; she would do nothing to help the South defend the institution. Whatever England did, the rest of Europe would have to follow. Emancipation would break the chains of four million men and women and put the United States to right with its professed ideals.  There was also a more practical argument. In 1862 the Union armies were hurt by a shortage of men. Defeats had produced war weariness, volunteering had fallen off, and the Congress had not yet opted for conscription. If he freed the slaves, Sumner told Lincoln, he could recruit the freedmen into the armed forces of the Union.

The Union must invite them to “come to use and united with us…be made free from rebel authority and rebel masters.”  On July 22 Lincoln read his entire cabinet a draft of the preliminary emancipation proclamation: on January 1, 1863, using his powers as Commander-in-Chief, he would free all of the slaves in the rebellious states.

Edwin Stanton and Edward Bates urged him to issue the proclamation at once, but Montgomery Blair warned that it would ruin the Republican Party in the fall elections, and Salmon Chase that it would undermine the financial stability of the government. Seward agreed, but argued that he must not issue the proclamation yet because the Union had not won any clear military victory. Europe would see the proclamation as “the last measure of an exhausted government, a cry for help, our last shriek on the retreat,” a desperate attempt to compensate for military defeat by provoking a slave rebellion behind Confederate lines.

On the other hand, if he issued his proclamation after a long string of losses, it would be seen as an act of desperation—a Hail-Mary pass attempted by a Commander-in-Chief who was losing the war.  Lincoln agreed to wait, but the bungling of George McClellan and the other generals in the eastern theatre made him wonder if they would ever win. Ironically, it was McClellan (a Democrat who sympathized with slavery and opposed military emancipation) who did provide the victory at Sharspburg on September 16.

With those exceptions, he declared the slaves “forever free.” Hostile historians have argued that beyond its value as propaganda, the proclamation added little to what Congress had already done. Even Seward objected, “we show our sympathy with slavery by emancipating where we cannot reach them and holding them in bondage where we can set them free.” The editor of the London Spectator jeered that the proclamation did not uphold “the principle that a human being cannot justly own another, but [instead] that he cannot own him unless he is loyal to the United States.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_74","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_74","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si16848","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si16873","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_75","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_75","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si16927","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si16952","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide15186","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Lincoln Stands Firm","thumbnail":"dr/Slide15186_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si23187","Image_126","Text_Caption_125","Text_Caption_126","btn_previous_74","si16848","si16873","btn_next_75","si16927","si16952"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide15186"}}},{"id":"si15311","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si15313","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_42","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_42","title":"A War to End Slavery ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_28","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_28","title":"The Emancipation Proclamation ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_127","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_127","title":"The Success of the Emancipation Proclamation ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_128","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_128","title":"Of course, the critics were wrong. In spite of its limitations, the proclamation was the most revolutionary measure ever taken by an American president. Even in the immediate wake of Lincoln’s declaration, the effects were dramatic. True freedom marched with the Union armies. As they smashed their way into the South, slavery crumbled. They encouraged slaves to abandon the plantations and farms and to demonstrate their desire to be free. They opened the armed forces to blacks. Some volunteered, some were coerced to join, and in all about 200,000 blacks, most of them emancipated slaves, fought to save the Union and liberate their brothers and sisters from bondage. In the long run, it made the actual destruction of slavery all but inevitable. And similar to the way that recent immigrants had proven their worth as citizens by repelling the British in the Revolutionary War (their proven valor and loyalty had been an argument for expanding the franchise and other rights of citizenship), so did newly liberated slaves now demonstrate their mettle as American citizens by protecting the Union from its aggressors. Thus Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation paved the way for the 13th Amendment, and his decision to enlist the freedmen in the Union Army paved the way for the 14th and 15th Amendments.

Only when he became convinced that it had become an “indispensable necessity” for winning the war did he choose that course. And for Lincoln’s detractors—those in April of 1864 who believed that the proclamation was not necessary—they must imagine how the Union army would fare without the “hundred and thirty thousand soldiers, seamen, and laborers” they had gained on account of the proclamation. “We have the men,” he said, “and we could not have had them without the measure.”  Thus Lincoln summed up the final irony of the Civil War. If the Southern states had remained peaceably in the Union, then the president would have had no constitutional authority to free the slaves in the existing states. If they had not persisted in the war, and fought so fiercely, then the president would not have possessed the constitutional authority to free the slaves. By their unlawful secession from the Union, as well as their continued persistence in the war, the Southerners had made emancipation constitutional by making it a military necessity—they had caused the very thing they had feared would happen (without cause) if they had remained in the Union.   Lincoln closed his defense of the Emancipation Proclamation by making it clear that he did not claim “to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.” He had already come to the conclusion that the drift of the war had taken a direction that was altogether different from the intention of those most closely connected with it.

It was the one institution that divided the nation. The sections shared the same values, “read the same Bible and prayed to the same God, and each invokes his aid against the other.” Then, an aside: “It may seem strange that any man should dare to ask a just God’s assistance in wringing their bread from sweat of other men’s faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_82","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_82","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17480","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17505","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_83","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_83","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17559","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17584","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_157","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_157","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_172","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_172","title":"Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_158","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_158","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_107","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_107","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19778","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19810","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_218","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_218","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide15620","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Investing the War with New Meaning","thumbnail":"dr/Slide15620_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si15654","si15656","Text_Caption_134","Text_Caption_135","btn_previous_82","si17480","si17505","btn_next_83","si17559","si17584","Image_157","Text_Caption_172","Image_158","Button_107","si19778","si19810","Image_218"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide15620"}}},{"id":"si15736","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_131","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_131","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_46","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_46","title":"A War to End Slavery ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_32","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_32","title":"Investing the War with New Meaning ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_136","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_136","title":"A Higher Purpose to the War ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_137","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_137","title":"Although both sides prayed to the same God and both prayed for victory: “The prayers of both could not be answered.

The Second Inaugural was Lincoln’s first public statement of this new understanding, but the idea had been percolating in his mind for at least two years. Sometime during the dark days of fall of 1862, Lincoln wrote these private meditations:   In the present civil war it is quite possible that God’s purpose is something different from the purpose of either party—and yet the human instrumentalities, working just as they, are the best adaptation to effect His purpose.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_138","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_138","title":"In his First Inaugural, Lincoln had explained that his purpose was to avert war if he could, and fight to preserve the Union if he could not.

In a letter written shortly after his inauguration, Lincoln admitted that while he thought that his speech might “wear better” than anything else he had ever said, it was not “immediately popular. Men are not flattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose between the Almighty and them.” Yet by investing the war with a greater meaning than mere human agency had given it, he was encouraging his countrymen to pursue a higher purpose than they had been willing to pursue before.
