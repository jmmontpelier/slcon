of the constitutional provisions regarding slavery, the Three-Fifths Clause became increasingly more controversial as it aged. During the Constitutional Convention, there had been a lively enough debate about including the ratio, but those who objected to it, though strenuous in their objections, were few in number. Also, the objections had usually turned on the principle of the question, or the appearance of the ratio. The only ones who objected to the actual result that it would produce—the relative political power between North and South—were certain members from the Southern states, who claimed that their political influence would not have its due weight. During the ratification debates, objections to the Three-Fifths Clause were sparse, and those that were raised hardly ranked among the most stinging criticisms of the Constitution.

The irony is that the North developed greater scruples over this clause even as it became clear that its effect would be less pronounced than most people had originally expected. When the Constitution was first drafted, the Southern states had reason to believe that proportional representation in the House would give them an edge over the old Articles of Confederation.

Nonetheless, the years immediately following the Constitution’s ratification seemed to justify the optimism of the South and the fears of the North. As Timothy Pickering noted ruefully to Rufus King, Kentucky had only two representatives in the census of 1790, but that number had swelled to six after the census of 1800. And even before that census had been tallied, Northeastern Federalists (of whom Pickering was one) had figured out that Thomas Jefferson could not have beaten John Adams for the presidency without the extra Electoral College votes derived from the “federal ratio” (the three-fifths ratio). Thomas Jefferson had received eight more Electoral College votes than John Adams, but by some calculations, twelve of his votes had been derived from “slave representation.” John Quincy Adams had described the resulting bitterness in this way: “The election of Mr. Jefferson to the presidency was, upon sectional feelings, the triumph of the South over the North—of the slave representation over the purely free.”  After the election of 1800—which had been divisive for so many reasons—Jefferson’s opponents began to refer to him as the “Negro President.” Pickering wondered aloud if the residents of New York could “ever rid themselves of negro Presidents and negro Congresses, and regain their just weight in the political balance?” For many members of the Federalist Party in the Northeast, the complaint that “the number of slaves is continually increasing” in the South was viewed as more of a political threat to their region than a moral evil for the nation.

After all, the Three-Fifths Clause did not merely affect the outcome of presidential elections. Several legislative measures that were favorable to the South and to slavery—such as the admission of Missouri as a slave state, the further extension of slavery into the territories ceded by Mexico, and the “gag rule” that prevailed in the 1840s—would likely have failed in the House if the Southern states were unable to augment their votes with representation based on slavery. The precise weight that augmented the Southern vote on account of their slaves was routinely tallied by the Northerners at the time. Abraham Lincoln calculated that in 1854 the slave states had 20 additional representatives on account of the Three-Fifths Clause, “being seven more than the whole majority by which they passed the Nebraska bill.” It is impossible to know for certain how the balance of power would have been different if the Constitution had denied any representation based on slavery, but it is certain that Southerners would not have exercised as much influence as they in fact did—in all three branches of the federal government—in the first half of the 18th century.

Many Northeastern Federalists objected to the Louisiana Purchase on account of the federal ratio. Josiah Quincy claimed that New Englanders would never have approved the Three-Fifths Clause if they could have foreseen that the United States would one day acquire land west of the Mississippi, thereby extending the influence of that clause. And Uriah Trace argued that acquiring Louisiana “would be absorbing the northern states” and making them “insignificant in the Union.” The inhabitants of Louisiana—mostly of Spanish and French descent—had principles that were “probably as hostile to our government, in its true construction, as they can be, and  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_126","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_126","title":"the relative strength which this admission gives to the southern and western interest is contradictory to the principles of our original Union as they can be, however strongly stated.” Five senators, all from Northern states, voted against the Louisiana Purchase treaty on these grounds.  When inhabitants of Louisiana petitioned Congress to open the African slave trade into their territory, it seemed to justify Tracy’s low opinion of the newest American citizens. The Three-Fifths Clause once more entered into the debates over Louisiana. After Quakers delivered their own petitions seeking to close the territory to the international slave trade, Southerns tried to argue that the Quakers had no grounds for personal grievance on the subject. In response, an argument from the Constitutional Convention was resurrected. The Constitution’s Three-Fifths Clause was a “real grievance” to the North, giving them an interest in preventing further imports of slaves from Africa.

Partly in reaction to the Louisiana Purchase, the Massachusetts legislature proposed a constitutional amendment that would have revoked the Three-Fifths Clause. They claimed that the original three-fifths compromise was intended to create a balance between the North and South, but instead it was giving the South too much influence. The “Ely Amendment,” named after its sponsor, William Ely, would have henceforth based representation on free population alone. Others, such as John Quincy Adams, advocated an amendment that would not try to rescind the Three-Fifths Clause from the existing states but would instead deny its application to any new slave states. Toward the close of the War of 1812, the Hartford Convention drafted a series of recommended amendments, among which was the proposal to apportion representation according to the population of free persons only. Even after it became clear that the balance of power was again tilting to the North, there would be additional attempts by the Northern states to amend the Three-Fifths Clause out of the Constitution.

In the House, James Tallmadge of New York tried to make Missouri’s admission into the Union conditional on a gradual emancipation scheme in that state, and he based his arguments partly on the injustice of the Three-Fifths Clause. That compromise, he said, was “an important benefit yielded to the slaveholding States, as one of the mutual sacrifices for Union.” He considered himself “pledged” to the existing slaveholding states in that regard—he would not try to amend the Constitution—but he insisted that the pledge did not apply to the new states. “That portion of country has no claims to such an unequal representation, unjust in its results upon the other States… Such an extension of that clause in the Constitution would be unjust in its operations, unequal in its results, and a violation of its original intention.”  In the Senate, David Morril of New Hampshire was making a similar argument. Slavery introduced an “unequal representation” within “the popular branch of the Government.” When applied to the existing states, its justice arose only because of the “compact and plighted faith, which we wish neither to disturb nor violate; but when the principle is applied to a new State, we view the subject entirely different.” The original compromise was meant to establish an equilibrium, he argued, but extending the principle further west would make cyphers of the Northeastern states.

We have made no promise; we have entered into no compact; we have given no pledge.” This line of reasoning received further support from John Taylor of New York and John Sergeant of Pennsylvania.

Modern historians, taken in by the rhetoric of the 19th century, argue that the South wanted to admit new slave states into the Union because they wanted to extend the “slave bonus” that the Three-Fifths Clause offered them. But in this instance, the Southern states were speaking the simple truth when they said that the Three-Fifths Clause was not a bonus but a liability. If new states were admitted on the condition that they prohibit slavery, then all of their inhabitants—whether black or white—would be counted fully. However, if they were admitted as slave states, then a portion of their population would be calculated at a lesser rate. All things being equal (which, of course, they never are), a free state had more representation than a slave state. As Frederick Douglass had argued, the Three-Fifths Clause “leans to freedom” in this regard, by automatically and immediately increasing the political importance of any state that chosen to emancipate its slaves.  Pennyslvania’s John Sergeant used that argument as a reason why Missouri should be adopted as a free state. He admitted that the Three-Fifths Clause in the Constitution must be extended to any slave state, not just those which had slaves at the time the Constitution was adopted, but by admitting states like Missouri as free states, they would avoid “infusing into the states to be formed, a debilitating disease, which will stint their growth, and lessen their political weight in the union.”  George Tucker of Virginia countered by reminding the House that adding Missouri as a slave state would not increase the number of slaves in the country; therefore, it would not extend the three-fifths ratio to a single slave who was not already counted by it. It would only mean that a slave that was currently counted as three-fifths east of Mississippi, upon moving into Missouri, would henceforth be counted at a rate of three-fifths there.

Indeed, the operations of the Three-Fifths Clause had a way of turning politicians into very precise mathematicians. Rufus King in 1819 could calculate that five voters in Virginia had as much political clout as seven voters in the free states.

Nonetheless, he insisted that when the question arose “whether new partners are to be bred up and brought into the firm, on the same degrading terms against me, I respectfully demur. I insist, that whether I shall be a whole man, or only the half of one, in comparison with others, is a question in which I am somewhat concerned.” The members of the existing states, he concluded, should be able to prohibit slavery in the new states, even if the residents of the new states preferred to allow it.
