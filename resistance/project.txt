The clause was drawn up hastily and passed unanimously. The only care that they took over its wording had meant to ensure 1) that it did not imply any moral sanction for slavery, and 2) that it did not require state officials to personally act as slavecatchers. The slipshod and vague wording of the clause, to say nothing of its content, would cause serious problems for the nation for the next 70 years. Yet, during the ratifying debates, not even the Antifederalists seemed very troubled by it. It provoked almost no opposition from Northern states and only lukewarm words of praise from the Southern states.  During this period, few people seemed conscious of any sharp distinction between the regions in the country. After all, slavery was still legal in every state but one, so the Fugitive Slave Clause could potentially benefit a slaveowner from almost any state. Also, every state had indentured servants among its residents, and the so-called Fugitive “Slave” Clause was in fact meant to provide for the extradition of anyone who owed “service or labor,” not just slaves. While there had been some Quaker abolitionists in 1787 who privately expressed bitter disappointment in the Fugitive Slave Clause—since they had hoped that Massachusetts might become an asylum for runaway slaves—it is improbable that the average citizens from Massachusetts had shared their hopes. In the late 1780s and early 1790s, the Fugitive Slave Clause had not seemed very significant.

At the very least, the country would not have adopted the clause so blithely, nor would it have taken the slapdash form in which it had been written.

There was one other aspect of the Fugitive Slave Clause that was especially problematic for Americans who had scruples about slavery. No other clause in the Constitution could be said to explicitly uphold the rights of the slaveholders. In all other respects, it could be said that the Constitution, while recognizing slavery as existing within the states, did not sanction it; the institution was upheld entirely by state laws. The Constitution, like Pilate, could “wash its hands” of responsibility and deny any complicity with slavery. The Fugitive Slave Clause, however, would not allow the federal government to remain morally aloof on the subject. It:  Required Congress to pass laws to protect the property claims of slave owners; Required federal officials and later, in practice, even state officials and ordinary citizens, to enforce these laws; and Denied any due process rights to the alleged fugitives.

The legislation had a curious and ultimately very sad history. It started when three men forcibly removed John Davis, an alleged slave, from Pennsylvania to Virginia. Whether or not Davis was in fact a slave at the time was a complex question involving the confluence of Pennsylvania’s Gradual Emancipation Act and a disputed border between Western Pennsylvania and Virginia, but the evidence is strong that he was not in fact a slave at this time according to the laws of Pennsylvania. In 1791, Governor Thomas Mifflin of Pennsylvania demanded the extradition of the three men who took him to Virginia, charging them with kidnapping. When Virginia’s governor refused, Mifflin turned to President Washington for help. In response, Washington asked Congress to pass legislation to address both issues: the extradition of fugitives from justice and the recapture of fugitive slaves. Congress began the process in 1791, but the two Houses did not reach a final agreement until 1793.

The congressmen in 1793, like the Framers in 1787, seemed unaware of the controversies that the legislation would eventually unleash, and the law did not provoke any real controversy at the time it was passed. In other parallels with the Fugitive Slave Clause it:  Also avoided using the word “slave.” Left vague the question of who was responsible for its enforcement. Did not clarify who was responsible for determining whether or not the alleged fugitive was really a slave.  The law merely required that those claiming the services of the alleged fugitive could take him either before a federal judge “or before any magistrate of a county, city ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_127","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_127","title":"or town corporate, wherein such seizure or arrest shall be made.” And the requirements for proving the status of the individuals to be removed were equally vague; the claimant was merely required to provide testimony or an affidavit that was “to the satisfaction of such judge or magistrate.” While it made no provision for those who fraudulently claimed a free person, those who unlawfully rescued a fugitive slave from the process of recapture were subject to a $500 fine. The same fine was levied upon someone who interfered with the capture of a fugitive from justice.  An important difference between the part of the law dealing with fugitives from justice and the part dealing with runaway slaves illustrated the casual way that the latter process was being treated. Demands for an alleged criminal had to come from the executive authority of a state—ultimately, its governor; the demands for runaway slaves could come from any private individual claiming to have legal title to a slave or even from any “agent or attorney” representing the claimant. This feature would leave the door wide open for dubious claims of ownership to free blacks. The law was written to give maximum convenience to slavecatchers and minimum protections to alleged fugitives. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, John Davis, the kidnapped freeman whose plight had precipitated the legislation in 1793, was never freed.

Even setting aside for the moment the appalling intentions of the Fugitive Slave Act—that someone held in bondage in the South, fleeing for liberty in the North, could lawfully be dragged back into a life of bondage—the law gave no assurances that any due process would be followed to ensure that victims of the law were in fact already part of the slave systems. The putative slave had no right to a trial by jury, no right to testify on his own behalf, and certainly no presumption of innocence. In practice, the Fugitive Slave Clause not only foiled many heroic attempts to rescue slaves who, by law, were held in bondage, but it also put every black freedman’s liberty in jeopardy by fortune-hunters and kidnappers.

They could include writs of habeas corpus, jury trials, the opportunity to testify on one’s own behalf, and the service of state attorneys. They also often required onerous state procedures for recaptions, and they included harsh penalties for kidnapping and the enticement of black persons out of state. Pennsylvania was, as ever, in the vanguard of antislavery measures. In response to lobbying efforts by resident abolitionists, Pennsylvania passed the first personal liberty laws in 1820 and 1826.  Both Acts erected numerous barriers to removing alleged fugitive slaves out of the state, and the 1826 law, in particular, set the hurdles high. One commissioner from Maryland called it “a ball to prevent runaway slaves from being recovered.” It granted numerous due process rights to alleged fugitives; it put the power of deciding the status of the alleged fugitive entirely within the hands of state judicial officials; it required the claimant to fulfill numerous onerous requirements; and any captor who tried evading these costly and difficult procedures could be subject to charges of felony kidnapping. Other states also passed personal liberty laws in the 1820s and 1830s, yet the constitutional status of these laws remained uncertain due to conflicting decisions by state and federal courts.

Her enslaved parents had been freed by their owner, John Ashmore. His heart had provided better than his head, however, because he never took any formal steps that would testify to their freedom. Margaret, who had never known a life in bondage, married a freeman, began to raise a family, and moved to Pennsylvania. When John Ashmore died, his widow and heir claimed ownership of Margaret and her children. Edward Prigg, acting as Mrs. Ashmore’s agent, tracked her down in Pennsylvania.

Nonetheless, the state’s case against Prigg was engineered with the deliberate intent to bring it before the Supreme Court. Many people wished to test the limits of the 1793 Fugitive Slave Law and the legitimacy of state laws like Pennsylvania’s. At issue were:   Whether state personal liberty laws, which were designed to protect free blacks from kidnapping, were unconstitutional violations of the Fugitive Slave Clause and the federal laws that were passed in pursuance of it. Whether it was the function of state or federal officials to deliver up a fugitive slave.  If there was one thing that everyone agreed on, however, it was that the Court had no authority to recover the freedom lost to Margaret Morgan.

Yet he proceeded to render a judgment that was generally considered to be a sweeping victory for the Southern states. He argued that the Constitution’s guarantee of the return of runaway slaves was of fundamental importance to Southern states, and they likely would not have adopted the Constitution without its protection.  Turning to the case at hand, Story argued that Congress’ power to legislate on this question was exclusive; that is, the states were not allowed to determine any of the procedures for the extradition of fugitive slaves. He concluded “that the act of Pennsylvania upon which this [kidnapping] indictment is founded, is unconstitutional and void.

The next day, Northup found himself chained in a holding facility waiting to be sold to the highest bidder. For several years, Northup’s friends and family searched for him in vain. It was not until 1852, while enslaved on a cotton plantation in Louisiana, that Northup, with the help of a sympathetic abolitionist, succeeded in getting a letter to New York alerting his wife, Anne, to the kidnapping and enslavement. New York happened to be one of the few states that allowed for the recovery of illegally enslaved free citizens. At Anne’s insistence, the governor intervened and succeeded in convincing the state Supreme Court in Louisiana to honor a writ demanding Northup’s freedom. Northup was returned to freedom, but only after twelve years apart from his family laboring as a slave. Twelve years of his life had been stolen, and yet he was one of the lucky ones, because the federal government refused to protect kidnapped slaves, and federal laws made it difficult for states to do so. Thousands of free blacks, unlike Northup, remained illegally enslaved for the rest of their lives.

The Court determined that state officials were not obligated to aid in the recapture of slaves, and so states took advantage of that reprieve. The decision led to a wave of laws forbidding the use of state and local resources for the purposes of capturing, holding, or transporting slaves.

In this instance, the perennial weakness of the federal government in the antebellum years was a boon to the antislavery cause.  Southerners grew increasingly frustrated at the difficulties they encountered when trying to recover their slaves. From their perspective, a slave who successfully achieved freedom in the North was not only a loss of property for the slaveowner, he was also a liability because he spread the seeds of hope among the slaves who remained in the South. Southerners were anxious to have their slaves returned and immediately resold “first,” in the words of Virginia Senator James Murray Mason, ”on account of the example” it gave to the other slaves. Abolitionists also recognized the power of such an example, and this consideration added yet another motive for foiling the Southern slavecatchers who were prowling the Northern states. The recalcitrant Northerners infuriated Southern representatives, which led to strident demands that the federal government should pass more effective laws to make good on the promise the Fugitive Slave Clause had given them.

They had a constitutional right to reclaim their slave property, after all, and instead of recognizing their rights, many Northern citizens were actively engaged in helping their slaves to escape. Although small individual societies for this purpose had been formed as early as the 1780s, but the 1830s there was a vast network of loosely affiliated organizations devoted to the cause. The Underground Railroad, as it came to be known, had innumerable supporters, including former slaves who infiltrated Southern plantations and acted as “conductors,” escorting slaves to freedom. An estimated 100,000 slaves escaped the Southern states during the years between 1810 and 1850.  Southerners had periodically sought to bolster the 1793 Fugitive Slave Law for many years, especially between 1817 and 1822. Since state authorities in the North could obviously not be counted on to help Southerners trying to recapture their slaves, they sought greater support from the federal government. A region that had depended for years on states’ rights arguments to bolster their proslavery claims was now demanding a law that would strengthen federal authority. They finally got their wish in the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which was part of a package of sectional compromises passed that year. And like so many of the other compromises with slavery, a law that was intended to promote national harmony and stifle extremism would of course have the reverse effect.

Even more grievous to conscientious white citizens in the North, the 1850 law required that “all good citizens are hereby commanded to aid and assist in the prompt and efficient execution of this law, whenever their services may be required.” Benign neglect of the Fugitive Slave Law was no longer an option. The law forced ordinary citizens to hunt down their fellow man—a more nasty business than ever was devised—and the people they were ordered to capture had committed no offense but to fly to freedom within their borders.

The supremacy of the federal government over the states was implicit in this new power, and that was not a reassuring thought. Many Southerners recognized that their problem had never been from a weak law but from a resistant population in the North. Mississippi Congressman Jacob Thompson thought the 1793 law was “full and strong enough, if the states of the North would comply.”  The new law was not likely to change that fact. By some accounts, very few slaves were recaptured under the 1850 act—perhaps 200 in the entire decade after it passed—but the antislavery backlash it unleashed was staggering.  A new spate of personal liberty laws were passed, deliberately aimed at sabotaging enforcement of the law and often flagrantly contradicting federal law. Vermont’s 1858 Freedom Act granted “jury trials to all alleged fugitives” and held that “neither slavery nor previous state of slavery should be grounds for denying state citizenship to any person.” Not content to defy federal law, Vermont’s law also flouted the Constitution; it declared every slave who came into the state free. These laws demonstrated that the Southerners were not the only ones who could appeal to states’ rights and state sovereignty when it suited their needs.

Booth vowed to “trample this law under foot, at the first opportunity.” True to his word, Booth was later arrested for aiding and abetting in the rescue of Joshua Glover from his captors. His arrest was yet another rallying point for the opposition to this harsh law. The Wisconsin Supreme Court issued writs of habeas corpus to free him from federal custody. Even more defiantly, it held that the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act was unconstitutional. The Taney Court later issued a writ of error for the Wisconsin ruling, whereupon the Wisconsin court ordered the clerk to ignore the writ. It was no less than a constitutional crisis between state and federal authority. Meanwhile, even small Southern victories were turned to Northern advantage in the propaganda wars. Abolitionist groups publicized every instance of a recaptured slave and made it a cause célèbre.  The earliest disputes over the Fugitive Slave Clause had revolved around protecting free blacks from getting caught up in the slave system through negligence or duplicity. The new attitude was that even persons considered slaves according to Southern laws should be delivered up—Fugitive Slave Clause be damned. The federal government took this new threat of anarchy and disunion so seriously that some were willing to treat resistance to the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act as treason. A district court judge instructed a grand jury that the definition of treason could include the forcible opposition to enforcement of a federal statute—even though his definition was contrary both to the Constitution and to subsequent precedents. Like the Alien and Sedition Acts of the 1790s, these attempts by federal courts to take a hard line with critics of the federal government backfired in a grand style.

When she first heard “kind, compassionate, and estimable people” deliberate upon what their “Christian duty” with regards to this law might be, the author “could only think, These men and Christians cannot know what slavery is; if they did, such a question could never be open for discussion. And from this arose a desire to exhibit it in a living dramatic reality.” One of the early episodes in the novel depicted a domestic scene within the home of Senator Bird, a state legislator from Ohio.   The senator had just voted in favor of a bill that would criminalize the act of aiding and abetting a runaway slave. Yet the same evening he personally is unable to turn out a runaway slave woman and her child when they come to his home for help. Instead, he helps them to escape.

It pricked the conscience of people in the North like nothing else before it had ever done. For the first time, a human face was put on the plight of the fugitive slave. The institution of slavery could not remain a political abstraction after that. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, and its graphic depiction in the novel, forced Northerners to seriously question their loyalties. If they, like Senator Bird, were faced with the alternative of helping the runaway slave or helping the slavehunter: which would they choose? For most Northerners, the moral choice was clear. No other slavery issue stirred the passions and spoke to the heart like this one did.  It is probably the stuff of legend that Abraham Lincoln once greeted Stowe with the words: “So you’re the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war.” But that story, even if it never happened, illustrates an important truth. Once the plight of fugitive slaves was presented to the Northern imagination as a living reality, the public could no longer believe that deferring to the Constitution, exactly as it was written, was the most important consideration in law. The Fugitive Slave Clause that had been added to the Constitution so carelessly was now undermining the whole fabric. And the one constitutional clause that was unambiguously intended to protect slave property in the South ultimately proved unenforceable in the North.

One of the most successful such initiatives was the “Underground Railroad,” which involved organizing escapes and assisting runaway slaves’ travel to freedom in Canada. Thousands of slaves secured their freedom in this way. Harriet Tubman, known as Black Moses, a runaway slave herself, personally led over nineteen separate missions. With a five hundred collar reward for her capture, dead or alive, Tubman’s exploits became a symbol of courage and defiance. In 1850, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act. The Act provided that anyone who helped a slave become free or hid a slave could be fined $1,000 or jailed for six months. Suddenly at risk of a return to bondage, thousands of slaves who had escaped to Northern states fled a second time to Canada. Slaves in Southern states now made Canada, a much longer journey, their ultimate and final destination.  The journey on the “Underground Railroad” was often difficult. Runaway slaves faced many risks, including starvation, exposure to severe climate conditions, and slave patrols, which were authorized to shoot, maim, and torture captured runaways. Nevertheless, slavery was so oppressive that oftentimes slaves determined that freedom was worth the myriad risks and, occasionally, runaway slaves about to be caught would kill themselves rather than suffer a return to slavery.
