The Constitution would change that dynamic, but only in very limited ways. The Constitution contains only three provisions that directly relate to slavery (click on options, below):      Nonetheless, in spite of convolutions meant to avoid naming slavery in the Constitution, the subject of slavery loomed large in the debates that shaped the Constitution and it would loom even larger in the constitutional history that would shape the country. The first two slavery clauses occasioned some of the bitterest disputes within the Convention, and all of the provisions have subsequently been criticized for being significant concessions to the slave-holding interests in the South. The rationales, development, and meaning of these clauses are complex. They arose out of a clash of diverse interests and conflicting principles that were held by the men who attended the Convention and, indeed, by the people who lived throughout the states at this time. In order to understand why the slavery compromises were forged, it is first necessary to understand the economic, political, and philosophical context of the time.

It is incomprehensible to many people today why the 55 men who formed a government intended to “establish justice” and “secure the blessings of liberty” could simultaneously perpetuate, and in some cases protect, the institution of perpetual hereditary bondage. In order to understand why the Constitution compromises with slavery in the way that it does, to say nothing of understanding why it fails to do more to solve the problem of slavery, it is necessary to first understand the political, social, and economic circumstances that led up to its framing and adoption.  Many of the Framers did recognize and deplore the evils of slavery, as a review of the Convention debates related to slavery will show. The language used by many of the Framers to describe slavery and the slave trade expressed the strongest moral condemnation. Language both moral and religious was used to inveigh against the abomination of slavery. Domestic slavery “was the curse of heaven on the states while it prevailed,” and slaveholders “bring the judgment of Heaven on a country…By an inevitable chain of causes and effects, Providence punishes national sins by national calamities.” But of course, the Framers were not a homogeneous body that agreed on the evils of the institution.

Indeed, if a person were reading the Constitution for the first time, it would not be easy to discover that certain clauses in the document even related to slavery, because the Framers were deliberately trying to avoid using the disgraceful word, “slave.” This was done (as Madison later recalled) to satisfy “those who were scrupulous of acknowledging expressly a property in human beings” in the Constitution. Instead, the Framers resorted to such squeamish circumlocutions as, “other Persons,” ”such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit,” and a “person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof.” In some cases, the Constitution’s Framers had no choice but to confront the existence of slavery within the states, but many were careful when crafting the Constitution’s language to try to minimize the suggestion that there were any legitimacy in the institution.

Although there were some delegates who held strong anti-slavery views, others, especially some members in the Northeast, spoke with indifference about the evils of slavery. The members from Virginia were strongly opposed to slavery in principle, but they also acknowledged that they—as representatives of their state or the South as a whole—must demand protections for the institution in the Constitution. And finally, there were members from the Deep South who would fairly be described as unabashedly pro-slavery. The simple truth was that the United States was a deeply divided people on this subject, even at this early date, and they had never before been required to devise a uniform policy on this question. The real question, then, is not “why is it that the Framers did not express their strongest moral outrage over slavery?” (some did), but rather, “why did their outrage accomplish so little toward righting the country’s deepest wrongs?” Fine phraseology is all well and good, but it is a poor consolation to any person who remains enslaved and treated like property.

It is revealing then, to contrast today’s critics of the Constitution to the attacks that were launched by the Constitution’s first detractors. During the ratification debates, many Antifederalists criticized the Constitution because it allowed the continuance of the slave trade for 20 more years, or because slaves were counted in the representation for Congress, or because of the sly wording used to describe slavery in the Constitution. One Antifederalist, writing under the name, Brutus, objected: “What a strange and unnecessary accumulation of words are here used to conceal from the public eye” that slaves were the persons who were being described by the Three-fifths Clause.

(Two of the Constitution’s Framers, Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton, were themselves active members in their own state’s abolitionist societies.) Many of the Quaker abolitionists expressed bitter disappointment that Congress would not be able to end the slave trade for 20 years (assuming they acted even then). And within some of their private correspondence (but never in print) a few members had also expressed dismay that the Fugitive Slave Clause would prevent Massachusetts from being the asylum for runaway slaves that many had hoped it would become. Nonetheless, the utmost that these anti-slavery societies had hoped to accomplish from federal action in 1787 was an immediate end to any further importation of slaves. They did not expect that the Convention’s delegates would be able to find a national solution to the problem of slavery as a whole.

Members from the Deep South—in particular the states of South Carolina and Georgia—were even more committed to the continuation of slavery than the Upper South. It was generally recognized that rapid expansion to the West would depend on a ready supply of slave labor, and that need was especially felt in the swampy, sultry regions west of Georgia and South Carolina. Faced with this reality, residents from these states had grown hardened, and sometimes even zealously committed, to making slavery a permanent institution in the South.  Within the Constitutional Convention, delegates from South Carolina and Georgia threatened to pack up and go home if the Constitution so much as encroached on their right of importing additional slaves from Africa. They insisted that, even if they used all their influence back home, the states of Georgia and South Carolina would never accept a Constitution that placed an immediate ban on slave importations. If the Deep South reacted in this way when some delegates insisted on a relatively painless measure—only that the African slave trade should be abolished—proposals of general abolition would have been met with even greater resistance, and from more than two Southern states. A sea change in the political and economic conditions of the South would have to take place before its political leaders (or their constituents) felt that they were ready to take practical steps toward abolition.

Most people at the time regarded their state governments as the receptacles for almost all legitimate power. They generally wanted the federal government to have control over only a few issues—war and peace, international relations, and interstate trade—those powers that were obviously of common concern to all states. There were only a very few Framers (to say nothing of the population at large) who had wanted to form a central government which could control the internal affairs of the states.

What enriches a part enriches the whole, and the states are the best judges of their particular interest.” Similarly, Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts “thought we had nothing to do with the conduct of the states as to slaves”; he was anxious that the national Constitution did not “give any sanction to it.” In these speeches, Ellsworth and Gerry were trying to urge their colleagues to refrain from interfering with the African slave trade—that the institution of slavery was an issue for each state to address individually.

There were some Northerners, and indeed even some Virginians and Marylanders, who indulged in a naïve optimism that slavery was on the long road to extinction even without any extraordinary efforts, and that optimism was not wholly without foundation. The Framers had witnessed a dramatic shift in national sentiment against slavery since the Revolution. Many of the northern and middle states had passed laws for gradual emancipation, and they could look forward to a slave-free population within a few decades. There were even rumors in 1785 that abolition was imminent in Virginia (alas, these rumors proved to be scare-mongering tactics of pro-slavery forces, but the rumor was believed by some people from other states). And during that same summer when the Convention was meeting, the Confederation Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance, which banned slavery within the Northwestern Territories. Seen in retrospect, 1787 could be seen as the high-water mark for a diffusive anti-slavery sentiment in America. The tide was about to turn, however, and pro-slavery forces in the South would grow even more belligerent in their demands to protect the institution.

Would that new power include the slave trade? Most states believe that it should, but the two southernmost states insisted that it should not.  Second, the states under the Articles had been represented equally, so there was no need to take notice of the unequal slave populations within the states. Many delegates to the Constitutional Convention, however, were adamant that representation should henceforth be proportioned to population. If population were now to be the basis for representation, how would slaves be counted in that reckoning?   These two slave-related questions—which were unavoidable because of institutional changes that they intended to make—would occasion some of the bitterest disagreements at the Convention.

The Fugitive Slave Clause — The Constitution gave clear protection to slaveholders, which was particularly reprehensible because there was no clear necessity to address this issue at all at the Convention.  The Constitution as originally written, however, in fact changed very little about the political dynamics of slavery in America. The old Confederation Congress had possessed virtually no power to interfere with slavery in America, and the new federal government was given only slightly more power over slavery’s fate.
