It reads: “The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government,” and also promises to protect the states from invasion and domestic violence. It would be fair to ask: Just who is responsible for defining what “a republican form of government” means, and exactly how would the federal government exert its authority to guarantee such a form in the states?

Later, Jefferson’s 1784 “Report on Government for Western Territory” again contained a guarantee clause, and similar to its final form in the Articles, that clause was immediately followed by a clause banning slavery in the Western Territories after 1800.  James Madison, as a member of Congress in 1787 and a close friend of Thomas Jefferson, was no doubt familiar with the history of the Guarantee Clause up to this point, and it no doubt influenced his wish to include something similar in the Constitution. He made his intentions clear in correspondence that he wrote during the spring of 1787. And Madison’s Virginia Plan, which was offered in the first days of the Convention, included a clause that guaranteed a republican form of government for the states. The Clause was adopted at the Convention with very little controversy.

According to fact and experience, a minority may, in an appeal to force, be an overmatch for the majority.” Madison defended the inclusion of the Guarantee Clause three times—once in an essay in the spring of 1787 titled, “Vices of the Political System of the United States,” once during the Convention, and a third time in Federalist No. 43. He used almost identical language to defend the clause in the first two instances (arguments that included a consideration of slavery), and he used a very different argument the third time (an argument that excluded any consideration of slavery).

During a low point toward the end of the Revolutionary War, several army officers had wanted to urge George Washington to join a military plot to take some unspecified action against the inept Continental Congress. Some of the rumors that were circulating suggested that there might have been some among them who wished to crown their General “King.” Washington refused to take part in any kind of insurrection of this kind, which has always added luster to his impeccable republican credentials. Many people at the time and since have assumed that if the same opportunity had been presented to a man of lesser virtue than Washington, America’s history might have been very different.

Several uprisings, some of them led by Daniel Shays, threatened peace and order, and at times they appeared to threaten the state administration itself. Neither the government of Massachusetts nor the Confederation Congress seemed competent to restore public order. Some of the arguments that Madison used to defend the Guarantee Clause in the Constitutional Convention are strikingly similar to those that he used in the Confederation Congress to defend mustering troops to suppress Shays’ Rebellion.  The threat to republican order that came form the elite in society was not unrelated to the threat that came from the underclass, as far as Madison was concerned. On numerous occasions he expressed the fear that anarchy would eventually beget monarchy. Unless republican forms of government could effectively prevent violent extremism and keep the peace, the people might soon cry out for a monarch who could do a better job at imposing order. For this reason, the Constitution’s clause guaranteeing a republican form of government is tied to the clause promising to protect states from invasion and domestic violence. If the people do not feel safe, then republicanism is not safe.

Madison merely said: “where slavery exists, the republican theory becomes still more fallacious.” The remark is cryptic, but it is not spontaneous or unreflective, because the exact same words are used both in Madison’s pre-Convention essay and in his arguments at the Convention. Many of those who write about slavery and the Constitution assume that Madison’s third threat is nearly identical to the previous one: that just as poor white inhabitants might foment insurrections, so too might slave revolts endanger republicanism. It is possible that something like this eventuality might have been on Madison’s mind, but it is more likely that Madison meant something else. He was someone who chose his words with care, and he did not say that slavery endangered republican forms of government; he said that it rendered republicanism “fallacious.”  We can gain insight into what Madison might have meant by examining his “Notes on Government” which he wrote a few years later, around 1791 and 1792. Some sections of these notes that were unpublished are among them. These notes reveal that the author of the Constitution’s clause guaranteeing to the states a republican form of government privately believed that the Southern states were not in fact republican forms of government. They lacked this qualification because of the high proportion of slaves who were denied political participation.

But to protect one part of society in their oppression of another part—all in the name of upholding republicanism—made no sense. Such a position seemed to suggest that only when the enslaved population has “been so far subdued as to bear the burdens, lashings and spurrings of the other portion without resistance, then the states will have been secured against ‘domestic violence,’ and the ‘republican form of government’ will be completely successful.” In reality, republican governments can only exist where “the mass of the people, if not the entire people, participate in the grant of powers to the government, and in the protection afforded by the government.” Such a form of government cannot exist where slavery exists. Securing the form of government that the Constitution guarantees is “indispensable, if not to the continuance of the union at all, certainly to its continuance on any terms that are either safe, honorable, or equitable for the north.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_87","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_87","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19069","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19094","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_88","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_88","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19148","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19173","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_206","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_206","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_222","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_222","title":"Lysander Spooner ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_207","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_207","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_148","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_148","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24727","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si24759","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide16031","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"More Extreme Antislavery Arguments","thumbnail":"dr/Slide16031_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si16065","si16067","Text_Caption_150","btn_previous_87","si19069","si19094","btn_next_88","si19148","si19173","Image_206","Text_Caption_222","Image_207","Button_148","si24727","si24759"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide16031"}}},{"id":"si16121","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si16123","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_46","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_46","title":"The Guarantee Clause and Slavery in the Nation’s Capital ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_33","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_33","title":"More Extreme Antislavery Arguments ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_134","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_134","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_151","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_151","title":"William Goodell Denounces Slavery as Illegal and Unconstitutional ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_152","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_152","title":"Reverance William Goodell became the chief spokesman for this more extreme interpretation.

Domestic violence included slave uprisings—in fact, from their point of view, they were the most likely cause of domestic violence—and the Constitution promised them protection from the most dangerous consequences of the slave system. In an open letter written by John C. Calhoun, he argued that no other clause in the whole Constitution was “more important.” Furthermore, so long as one had “the right understanding” of the Guarantee Clause, “the success and duration of our political system” depended more on this clause than any other.  Channeling Madison’s public defense of the Guarantee Clause in Federalist No. 43, Calhoun insisted that the federal government, when interpreting the meaning of republican, “has no right whatever, in any case, to look beyond [the state’s] admission into the Union.” The condition of the states at the time is the “proper standard” for understanding the word, and the federal government could only intervene if the states became less republican than they were at the time the Constitution was adopted. If the federal government claimed more than that—if it claimed “the right to establish its own abstract standard of what constitutes a republican form of government”—then that would make it “the absolute master of the States.” In such a case, “instead of tranquility, safety, and liberty,—anarchy, insecurity, and despotism would universally prevail.” This outcome certainly could not have been the intentions of those who adopted this clause.

The reason why the Framers did not want the capital to lie within an existing city (as were almost all of the capital cities in Europe) was because they wanted to avoid the appearance or reality of favoritism to any one state. The capital must exist geographically and politically independent of any of the states. Even with this limitation, many states immediately began vying with each other to have the capital situated within its borders. Offers to cede state territory were included within ratification statements. With proximity, after all, comes potential influence, and each state that had a shot at attracting the federal government—especially New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania—put in its bid.  The site of Washington, D.C. was finally chosen after a deal was engineered by Thomas Jefferson between Alexander Hamilton and James Madison. Hamilton would buck resistance from his fellow New Yorkers and support the choice to situate the capital close to Virginia if Madison would stop fighting the Treasury secretary’s funding bill. Although later historians would portray this choice as driven primarily by sectional interests, it really seemed more a question of individual state influence.

Appealing to the principles of the Revolution, Sloan’s Act would have begun the process on the Fourth of July. The House soundly rejected the proposal, with 77 of the 108 members present voting against it. Only one Southerner, John Archer of Maryland, voted in favor of gradual emancipation in Washington.  The question of the continuing existence of slavery in the capital became an important symbol for Northerners and Southerners alike. Northerners wanted slavery outlawed at the nation’s seat in order to show that the federal government had a policy for discouraging the institution. And Southerners wanted it to remain in order to fortify their argument that Congress sanctioned it, or at least could do nothing about it. Not content to argue that slavery should be lawful in the capital, Southerners tried a number of strained legal interpretations to explain why Congress had no authority to outlaw slavery in the District. The capital, after all, had been created on lands ceded by two slave states. Southerners argued that Virginia and Maryland only granted the land based on an understanding that slavery would continue there. They claimed that this understanding was part of the “intent” of the original deeds, and Maryland’s Senate backed up that claim in 1837 by asserting that general emancipation in Washington would be “a violation of the terms and conditions upon which the cession of the District of Columbia was made to the Federal Government.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_101","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_101","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20175","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20200","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_102","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_102","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20254","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20279","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_224","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_224","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_231","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_231","title":"John Archer (MD) ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_225","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_225","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_157","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_157","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si25690","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si25722","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_267","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_267","title":"The Taylors: Madison Slaves in the Capitol ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_274","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_274","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_275","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_275","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_178","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_178","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si28853","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si28879","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide16602","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Trying to Abolish Slavery in the Capital","thumbnail":"dr/Slide16602_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si16636","si16638","Text_Caption_165","btn_previous_101","si20175","si20200","btn_next_102","si20254","si20279","Image_224","Text_Caption_231","Image_225","Button_157","si25690","si25722","Text_Caption_267","Image_274","Image_275","Button_178","si28853","si28879"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide16602"}}},{"id":"si16716","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si16718","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_54","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_54","title":"The Guarantee Clause and Slavery in the Nation’s Capital ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_41","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_41","title":"A Wave of Petitions ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_166","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_166","title":"Targeting the District ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_167","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_167","title":"As the abolitionist movement became more active and more organized in the 19th century, targeting slavery in the District became a focus of their activities.

Southerners tried to quash these demands through various methods of treating these petitions with contempt, which only added to the zeal of the abolitionist groups. Prior to the great petition war of 1835-1844, antislavery petitions had usually been treated with a kind of benign neglect. They were often shunted to standing committees never to be heard from again. Increasingly, however, abolitionist groups began to realize the propaganda potential in these petition drives.  In 1829, a representative from Pennsylvania, Charles Miner, used a petition aimed at abolishing slavery in the District as a launchpad to deliver an antislavery diatribe in the House. Abolitionist groups used every step involved in submitting petitions to Congress—drafting the petitions, printing and distributing the forms, gathering thousands of signatures, then engaging the support of their congressmen—to inspire an unprecedented level of civic engagement. Many women’s groups were deeply involved in these petition drives. Each activity in the process was potentially a persuasive tool for winning converts to the cause.

He argued that congressional sanction of slavery in the District was contrary to common law; it was contrary to the original cession terms of Maryland and Virginia; and, finally institutions deprived slaves of their liberty and property without due process.

Henry Wise of Virginia insisted that petitioners “cannot attack the system of slavery without attacking the institutions of our country, our safety, and our welfare.” Still other suggestions for dealing with antislavery petitions were made by Southern members: tabling them, throwing them under the table, or even burning them in the chamber! The more moderate of the extremists got largely got their wish.  The “gag rule” that Congress imposed was not quite as unconstitutional as what some Southern members had wanted. Martin Van Buren, who was vice president at the time (and therefore president of the Senate), sought a compromise position in 1836. He backed resolutions proposed by Henry Laurens Pinckney in the House that Congress “ought not to interfere” in the institution of slavery in the District, and added that any petitions that “in any way” touched on the subject of slavery “shall, without being either printed or referred, be laid on the table, and that no further action whatever shall be had thereon.” Calhoun sought to head off these milquetoast measures in the Senate by arguing that the power of each House to “determine the rules of its proceedings,” given in Article I of the Constitution, trumped the right to petition found in the 1st Amendment. He lost that fight and similar resolutions were passed in the Senate. A more extreme version of the gag rule would later be passed in 1840, but it received far less support.

An even more serious motion to censure Adams occurred in 1842. By this time, Adams courted the censure debate, because it gave him yet another platform from which he could defend the right of petition. He got his wish: the censure of Adams was debated for two weeks. In 1844, Adams finally succeeded in rescinding the gag rule. But slavery in the District was no closer to coming to an end.

Virginia took drastic measures and reclaimed the land it had originally ceded for the Federal City. The “retrocession” movement had begun in the Virginia portion of the capital as early as 1824, and the original reasons for wanting to be reabsorbed into the state of Virginia were more economic than ideological. But in 1844 it was once again open season on congressional debates to abolish slavery and the slavery trade in the district. These debates added fuel to an already slow-burning fire. The slave market was a lucrative business in Alexandria. The Richmond Assembly formally requested Virginia’s land back and Congress agreed in 1846. The transfer was completed by 1847, and the nation’s capital lost a third of its originally territory. Over the next fifteen years, the number of free blacks living in Alexandria (now a part of Virginia) declined considerably.

Solomon Northup, whose Twelve Years a Slave recounted his harrowing experiences of being kidnapped and solid into slavery, had first been abducted in the nation’s capital. He described being held in a slave pen within sight of the U.S. Capitol. The spectacle of chained gangs of slaves being marched through the city on their way to the market shamed many federal politicians, including many Southerners. When this spectacle met James Madison as he was walking through the streets of the city, his secretary and good friend, Edward Coles, made free to “jeer” at the president.   The loss of the Alexandria portion of the District also presented an opportunity. With the greater part of the slave market removed from the boundaries of the city, it was easier to ban the domestic slave trade that remained as part of a compromise package passed in 1850. Slavery, however, would continue to be legal in the capital until April 16, 1862, when President Lincoln signed into law the District of Columbia Emancipation Act. The act provided immediate emancipation for the slaves and compensation for the slaveowners loyal to the Union. Although it was too long in coming, Emancipation Day was greeted with joy and celebrated for many years in the District on April 16.

With a little ingenuity, almost any clause in the Constitution could be interpreted to the advantage of proslavery or antislavery legislators.
