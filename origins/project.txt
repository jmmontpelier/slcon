Even limiting our examination to slavery in British North America, the conditions varied widely. The life of slaves was shaped by their location (upper or lower south), the size of the farm or plantation on which they worked, the stable crop (tobacco, rice, cotton, or sugar), the number of slaves on the plantation or farm, the economic status of the owner (long established or upwardly mobile), and most important, the character of the owner (paternal, brutal, or somewhere in between).

But in less than a century, colonists had laid the foundations of the “peculiar institution.” The first Africans arrived in Jamestown in 1619. By 1700, when they began flooding into the southern colonies, the colonists were treating them radically different than white indentured servants. By 1700, if not earlier, they had reduced almost all blacks to chattel slavery, to a legal status that ran directly counter to English law and tradition.  Unfortunately, details of the process are lost in the mists of history. There is too little evidence for historians to determine with any real certainty when, how, or why colonists came to treat blacks so different from whites. There is only enough to allow us to disagree about the matter.  In White Over Black, published in 1968, Winthrop Jordan suggested that the development of slavery in the English tobacco colonies passed through three stages. The first blacks may have arrived in 1619, ironically only a few days after the meeting of the first representative assembly in North America. The colonists totally failed to recognize the importance of the event. In his journal, John Rolfe described it in a single sentence:   About the last of August came in a Dutch man of warre that sold us 20 negars.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_134","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_134","title":"Total Slave Population 1790-1860 ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_133","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_133","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_135","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_135","title":"Winthrop’s Three Stages of Slavery ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_134","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_134","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_136","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_136","title":"Elmina Castle ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_135","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_135","roles":{}},{"id":"S4_button_previous_78","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"S4_button_previous_78","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17203","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17228","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"S4_button_next_79","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"S4_button_next_79","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17282","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17307","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_152","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_152","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_153","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_153","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_243","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_243","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_73","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_73","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si15738","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si15764","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_74","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_74","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si15820","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si15846","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_105","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_105","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20339","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20365","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide15061","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Jamestown and Early Colonial Slavery","thumbnail":"dr/Slide15061_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si15095","si15097","Image_241","Text_Caption_122","Text_Caption_123","Text_Caption_134","Image_133","Text_Caption_135","Image_134","Text_Caption_136","Image_135","S4_button_previous_78","si17203","si17228","S4_button_next_79","si17282","si17307","Image_152","Image_153","Image_243","Button_73","si15738","si15764","Button_74","si15820","si15846","Button_105","si20339","si20365"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide15061"}}},{"id":"si15881","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si15883","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_38","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_38","title":"Slavery and its Appearance in British North America ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_24","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_24","title":"Jamestown and Early Colonial Slavery ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_137","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_137","title":"The Perception of Inferiority ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_138","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_138","title":"Blacks continued to trickle into Virginia for the next half century, but before 1640 there is very little evidence of how whites treated them. After 1640 there is increasing evidence that whites treated at least some of them as slaves, holding them in perpetual hereditary slavery. After 1660 the evidence is clear; the colonists wrote slavery into the statutory law. In 1705, the General Assembly enacted the first black code in North America.  There is almost no evidence about the first black arrivals. Traders sold blacks to colonists in Virgina, but they also sold them white indentured servants. Blacks were not completely free, but neither were most whites. But from the start, whites set blacks apart by calling them “negros.” The term referred to race, not to legal status, but the name suggests that white colonists perceived blacks as different and therefore inferior. It is possible that the status of blacks in the colony was never the same as the status of whites, but we can’t be certain.  The evidence suggests that from the start some blacks served their masters for life and some inherited their status from their mothers.

The General Court of Virginia imposed sentences on three servants who ran away to Maryland. It ordered the two whites to serve their masters for one additional year each; it ordered the third servant, who was black, to serve for life. No white servant in any English colony in North America ever received such a sentence. In the same year, the same court sentenced 6 of 7 runaways, who were white, to serve additional time, but did not force the seventh runaway to serve additional time as well. He was black and likely was already serving for life.  Further evidence that colonists were holding at least some black servants as slaves for life lies in the prices paid for them. Presumably they valued black servants more highly than whites, because of the time the blacks remained in bondage, for life rather than five to seven years. Black women were especially valuable, because their owners could hold any children the women bore for life. Perhaps this was also because, unlike white women, owners could force black women to work in the field.  There were other ways that white settlers subjected blacks to degrading distinctions that were not immediately related to slavery. A law enacted by the General Court of Virginia in 1640 denied blacks the right (and obligation) to carry arms and serve in the militia. Life in the colony forced men to carry arms to protect themselves from Indians and wild animals. The prohibition demonstrated that blacks, even free blacks, did not enjoy full membership in white society.

Before 1640 the evidence is unclear. It is impossible to determine if the whites’ hostile reaction to intercourse between blacks and whites came before or after the legislature first formally recognized the existence of slavery in the colony. In 1630, the General Court sentenced a white man to be whipped “for abusing himself to the dishonor of God and the shame of Christians, by defiling his body in lying with a negro.” But the Negro might not have been a woman and the court might have punished the man for homosexuality, or it may have punished him for fornication, and not for miscegenation. By 1662, the colonists’ opinion of interracial sexual activity was unmistakable. In 1662, the General Assembly provided that whites who engaged in any sexual activity with blacks would pay double the usual fine. In 1691, it prohibited all sexual contact between blacks and whites.  The evidence strongly suggests that legal recognition of slavery followed the establishment of the institution in Virginia rather than preceded it. The General Assembly demonstrated that it was aware that most blacks were not serving their masters on the same terms as whites in 1660 when it provided that servants who came to the colony from Christian nations without indentures would serve no longer than indentured servants from England. It implied that Negroes would serve longer. In 1661 it did recognize slavery directly, providing that white servants who ran away with blacks would make good on the black’s lost time as well as their own. Presumably it recognized that blacks could not make good on their own lost time because they were already serving for life.

At the end of that period, servants would receive their freedom, and perhaps land, animals, and tools. For a time, the supply of indentured servants was seemingly limitless. The English population was growing rapidly, but the English economy was not.

Laws increased the terms of men and women who entered the colony without contracts, and increased punishments for servants who ran away or attacked their masters or ate their masters’ hogs. (A court in Lancaster County sentenced a servant who killed three hogs to six years extra service.)  Servants who completed their indentures and gained their freedom faced uncertain futures. It was almost impossible for a poor man to acquire land except on the frontier where Indians made life extremely precarious. During the 1630s the price of tobacco collapsed, and most of the men who had acquired land lost it and had to work for wages. In other words, they had to return to their former lives as servants or, they had to squat on land they did not own or become criminals or vagrants, which many of them did.

There were several ways the planters could have solved the problem. They could have granted land to the servants who had completed their indentures, but they rejected that solution—they were unwilling to give up even a small part of their holdings. They could have also put an end to the flood of indentured servants entering the colony. In fact, during the last quarter of the 17th century, the flood did diminish. The enclosure movement, set off by the enormous European demand for wool, the rapid change from the cultivation of grain to the pasturage of sheep, and the equally rapid depopulation of the countryside ended. In time, the growth of cities and factories provided employment for the men and women who had been forced to migrate, and the flood of indentures became a trickle.

It made no sense to pay more for a slave than an indentured servant because neither was likely to live for very long. By mid-century, however, the mortality rate fell and an investment in slaves became more economically rational. Slaves cost much more, but unlike servants did not gain freedom after seven years and did not make demands planters were unwilling to grant. At approximately the same time, the demand for slaves in Latin America decreased somewhat, making slaves coming from Africa more readily available in North America. Planters quickly turned to slave labor, and by 1700, approximately half of the labor force in Virginia was composed of enslaved Africans.

The increase in the purchase of slaves ran parallel to the decrease in the purchase of servants, and in turn to the decrease in the number of men and women gaining freedom and demanding a place in society that planters were unwilling to give them. Of course, slaves (especially the first generation of slaves who had not yet accepted their enslavement) posed a constant threat to the peace and security of the colony, but not as great a threat as a large and growing population of young, impoverished, rootless, undisciplined, well-armed, frequently violent white men would have posed. Blacks had none of the expectations that made servants so troublesome. They did not suffer from the sexual imbalance that made the early history of the colony so unstable. Unlike white women, black women worked in the tobacco fields and produced children who inherited their mothers’ status. As a result, traders imported a high ratio of women, and in that way unintentionally reduced the level of black discontent. Discontent remained, of course, but planters were prepared to put down even the slightest show of resistance with a ferocity far greater than they could impose on whites. The repression of slaves would not cut off the flow of unfree labor from Africa or provoke protests from African governments. As a result, no slave revolt in American history approached the dimensions or success of Bacon’s Rebellion.

Individual members and small groups within the Society of Friends (Quakers) had been speaking out against slavery from the beginning, but chapters of the Society did not actually forbid its members from holding slaves until the 1770s (and this prohibition was sometimes awkward to enforce, since it was not yet even legal to manumit one’s own slaves in some states).

By some accounts, this small group, predominantly made up of Quakers, was the world’s first abolitionist society. The forces that had been protecting the institution of slavery, then, were already well established in America before the forces opposing slavery began to find their footing.  As the colonists began to resist British authority, they increasingly appealed to the rights that were due to all men as human beings, rather than appealing only to the traditional rights that were due to them as Englishmen (and hence did not apply to African slaves). These Enlightenment arguments were not initially made with any reference to the institution of slavery, but the implications of their arguments were unmistakable. John Dickinson, writing as “A Farmer in Pennsylvania,” described “the lover of liberty” as being “natural to the human heart.” He argued that, since the British had taxed the colonists without their consent, “We” (meaning the British colonists of North America) “are therefore—SLAVES.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"S4_button_previous_109","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"S4_button_previous_109","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22206","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22231","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"S4_button_next_110","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"S4_button_next_110","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22285","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si22310","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide21325","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The Laws and Politics of Slavery in the States","thumbnail":"dr/Slide21325_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si21428","Text_Caption_183","Text_Caption_184","S4_button_previous_109","si22206","si22231","S4_button_next_110","si22285","si22310"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide21325"}}},{"id":"si21491","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si21493","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_54","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_54","title":"Slavery and its Appearance in British North America ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_37","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_37","title":"The Laws and Politics of Slavery in the States ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_185","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_185","title":"“The Loudest Yelps” from the Colonists ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_186","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_186","title":"But the moral high ground that supported the colonists’ resistance against British dominion was belied by the prevalence of a much more gross and obvious form of slavery in their midst.

The prevalence of chattel slavery—which existed to some degree in all thirteen colonies—made the Patriots’ claims that they were being enslaved by their British oppressors seem, at best, like hyperbole, and at worst like hypocrisy. Thus Samuel Johnson’s famous taunt—”How is it we hear the loudest yelps for liberty from the drivers of Negroes?”—struck home precisely because the inconsistency between the colonists’ arguments and their actions was so obvious to everyone.  Nonetheless, these early appeals to the natural liberty of men were not cynical, self-serving slogans. At least, many of the men who uttered them were sincere and intellectually consistent, and the steady drumbeat of their appeals would indelibly affect the way that Americans would view the institution of slavery. Enlightenment ideals emphasizing the natural liberty of all would eventually find common cause with a religious position that had previously lingered only on the fringe of society: that it was wrong for one person to treat another like a slave.

State legislatures were repeatedly goaded by petitions submitted by Quakers and Methodists. But their motivations for emancipation were also clearly derived from the new fervor for respecting the natural rights of man that had been spawned by the Revolution. In 1780, even before the war had ended, Pennsylvania passed the first Gradual Abolition Act. The Preamble of the Act describes the drafters’ abhorrence of that condition to which the arms and tyranny of Great Britain were exerted to reduce us,” and then it drew parallels between their own condition and the condition of slaves within their own state.  Pennsylvania’s Abolition Act was indeed gradual; it only freed slaves who were born in Pennsylvania after the Act was passed, and then only after they had reached the age of 28. But for the first time it gave the hope of freedom to thousands of enslaved men and women, and other states would soon follow suit.  Rhode Island and Connecticut both passed gradual emancipation acts in 1784. Other states, after dragging their heels, followed their example. New York’s legislature voted overwhelmingly for gradual emancipation in 1799, and New Jersey’s legislature finally passed a similar measure in 1804. New Hampshire never passed a law banning slavery, but neither did there seem to be many slaves to outlaw (158 slaves in 1790, dwindling to 8 slaves by 1800).

It was more fundamental, because many states were including declarations of rights—declarations that proclaimed that liberty was a universal principle—within their states’ founding political documents. It was more ambiguous, however, because each state would interpret the implications of these principles differently. Virginia had led the charge. Even before Thomas Jefferson had penned the Declaration of Independence, George Mason inserted these words in the first article of Virginia’s Declaration of Rights, which was adopted on June 12: 1776:   That all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.  Massachusetts adopted a Declaration of Rights with very similar wording only a few years later, in 1780. Whereas Vermont’s 1777 Declaration of Rights had tied these same principles of natural rights to an immediate and explicit abolition of slavery, the constitutions formed in other states had not.

Jennison was convicted of assault and battery against Quock Walke in a lower court; Jennison had beaten Walker and claimed to own him as a slave. Walker had claimed only that he was a free man by virtue of the promises made to him by his previous owner, who had since died. When the case was appealed to the state’s Supreme Court, however, the attorney representing Walker shifted his focus form the promises given by his former owner to the promise that was latent in the state’s constitution.

Yet Virginia’s history would develop very differently. The state of Massachusetts had never been home to many slaves, so a sudden judicial decision banning the institution could not lead to any social or political upheaval. Virginia’s 1790 census, on the other hand, had enumerated nearly 300,000 people, almost 40 percent of the state’s population, as suffering from perpetual bondage. Slavery was woven into the fabric of Virginian society, and there were powerful political and economic forces that meant for it to stay that way.  When Edmund Randolph later related the history of Virginia’s adoption of its Declaration of Rights, he recalled that at least one member objected to the sweeping language about all men being “by nature equally free and independent.” Robert Carter Nicholas feared that such promises might one day lead to “civil convulsion.” Other members reassured him on this point, though in Randolph’s opinion it was done with “an indifference to futurity” and with some “inconsistency.” The white population in Virginia, it was said, had “arms in our hands,” but the “slaves, not being constituent members of our society, could never pretend to any benefit from such a maxim.” When Virginia’s leaders drafted the Declaration of Rights in 1776, they were fixated on the momentous decision immediately before them: they were deliberately picking a fight with the most powerful empire on earth. It was no time to worry about logical consistency within their own borders.

In 1782, the Virginia legislature passed a law that made it legal, for the first time, to voluntarily manumit one’s own slaves without obtaining special permission from the state. A few years later, in 1785, some members from a Methodist group tried to push the state still further: they submitted a petition to the legislature seeking a gradual abolition law in Virginia. This action was a set too far, too fast, and it caused a small firestorm. Some delegates sought to throw the petition “under the table” (a sign of contempt). Outraged, the legislature came within an ace of repealing the new law that allowed voluntary manumissions. James Madison reported that the petition for abolition received “an avowed patronage of its principle by sundry respectable members,” but it was nonetheless doomed; the delegates rejected it without dissent. Many of the leading Virginians cherished hopes that some future day would see an end to slavery in their midst, but very few were read to take any significant strikes toward that goal.   The lesson that Virginia lawmakers learned from the winter session of 1785-86 was that trying to push the slavery question too fast would only provoke a violent reaction from the pro-slavery forces. It was better to bide one’s time, they thought, and seek abolition when people were more ready for it.

Not everyone fully appreciated the vastly different circumstances of the two regions. At the beginning of the Revolution, all of the colonies had countenanced some degree of slavery within their borders while at the same time proclaiming the natural right to freedom inherent in all people. Within a few decades, all of the Northern states had taken some action to reconcile their practices with their deals. Sadly, there is more than one way to achieve logical consistency. Over time, the Southern states would find that it was far easier to renounce or reinterpret those Founding ideas rather than trying to live up to them. Still, no one at this time could know that political developments lay in wait.

For better or for worse, all of the significant changes relating to the legal status of slaves were taking place within the state governments: their constitutions, their laws, and their judicial decisions. No significant action took place at the federal level, nor did anyone at the time expect that it should. In its 1774 Articles of Association, the Continental Congress had proclaimed its intention to “wholly discontinue the slave trade.” But this proclamation had more to do with thwarting the British than trying to exercise any real authority over state slave imports. The Continental Congress knew that it had no authority to enforce such a ban in the states, and the states knew it as well. The federal action was generally ignored by those who chose to ignore it, although many states passed their own prohibitions on the international slave trade. Even the Quakers—who had repeatedly submitted anti-slave trade petitions to the Confederation Congress in the first half of the 1780s—finally had to give up and admit that the ragtag Congress possessed no power and no respect. Any positive steps toward abolition were taking place within the states.  The powerless of the central government under the Articles of Confederation, and the expectations it engendered within the states, must be understood in order to understand what eventually took place—and what failed to take place—within the Constitutional Convention.
