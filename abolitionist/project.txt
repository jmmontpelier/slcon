economic boom. Merchants and bankers were inventing more ways of doing business. Entrepreneurs were building roads and canals, and later, railroads, linking distant cities, moving people and freight faster and farther and cheaper than ever before. Settlers were flooding across the mountains into the West, producing mountains of meat and grain and cotton, stimulating the growth of commerce and industry. The population was growing rapidly. Towns and cities were springing up. It seemed as though everybody was getting rich.  In much of the nation, people welcomed the changes that were revolutionizing their lives. But not everywhere.

Not in parts of the mid-Atlantic states where change was so rapid, so relentless that it overwhelmed the ability of people to adjust. Not in parts of the South where the soil was exhausted and the competition of the Black Belt was too great.  The cultural consequences of the economic change were dramatic. The Second Great Awakening, a great wave of revivals that began on the Kentucky frontier at the start of the 19th century, swept over “the burnt-over district” during the 1820s and 1830s, and in time affected the entire nation, though in different ways in different times and places. Evangelists like Charles Grandison Finney and Lyman Beecher preached to enormous crowds, often in open-air camp meetings. They exploited the widespread dissatisfaction with orthodox Protestantism that had grown rigid, intellectual, and emotionless. By demanding that true Christians work to perfect society, the Great Awakening made incalculable contributions to the success of the reform movement in the 1830s and 1840s.

They tried to put an end to Sunday mail and to close grog shops, gambling dens, and brothels. The most zealous tried to wipe out Roman Catholicism. In 1834 in Boston, Lyman Beecher preached anti-Catholic sermons that inspired a mob to burn a convent to the ground. In 1836, Timothy Dwight published “an exposé” of life inside a convent in Montréal. It was pornography disguised as religion, was completely fictional, and sold like hotcakes.  Fortunately, most of the reforms championed by evangelicals were less destructive. The Sons of Temperance battled demon rum, and by 1855 thirteen states had prohibited manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages. Dorothea Dix crusaded for the reform of prisons and asylums, Catherine Beecher campaigned for education for women, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lecretia Mott for votes for women, and Horace Mann and Bronson Alcott for public education. Sylvester Graham campaigned against sex: masturbation was a “filthy vice,” and married couples should make love no more than once a month. Amelia Bloomer campaigned for trousers. “Come Outers” established at least a hundred utopian communities: John Humphrey Noyes at Oneida, New York, where inhabitants practiced communism, and George Riplet at Brook Farm, Massachusetts, where they combined plain living with deep thinking. And there were many others.

Of course, evangelicals were not the first Americans to condemn the institution and work for its destruction. During the colonial period new religious and intellectual movements convinced many that slavery was wrong. The First Great Awakening convinced Baptists and Methodists that slavery was not punishment for original sin, but instead a gross violation of Christian ethics and morality. The European Enlightenment convinced intellectuals that all men had a natural right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The first opponents were Quakers, notably John Woolman and Anthony Benezet. Benezet wrote at least nine tracts attacking slavery and the slave trade, lobbied colonial legislatures, and ran a school for blacks. Woolman traveled throughout the colonies, made two extended trips into the South in 1746 and 1757, and three shorter trips between 1766 and 1768. There he confronted slaveowners, pleading with them to free their human property. His efforts bore some fruit. Quaker meetings in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina first recommended that owners treat their slaves humanely, then expelled members who bought and sold slaves, and finally expelled members who refused to free their slaves. They had no success in the lower South and in the South as a whole where their numbers were small and their influence even smaller.

The Methodists would become the largest denomination in the South by the middle of the 19th century, and through their circuit riders and camp meetings the most active. Led by Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke, the General Conference condemned slavery in 1780. In 1784 it voted to expel members who refused to free their slaves, setting off an explosion, and the church suspended the ruling. In 1816 it conceded that the evil was “past remedy,” and turned its attention to evangelizing the bondsmen. Abolitionists gradually won support in the North, won control of the General Conference, and in 1844 condemned two bishops who refused to free their slaves. The Southern delegates bolted, and the following year formed the Methodist Episcopal Church South. The Baptists and Presbyterian churches followed similar paths, first condemning slavery, later defending it.   At the same time, objections to slavery based on religion merged with objections based on the natural rights philosophy of the Enlightenment. American patriots drew on that philosophy to justify their resistance to British tyranny, and many found it impossible to ignore the implications of their arguments for slavery.

Before the age of 12 and after the age of 50, slaves were economic liabilities, not assets. Many planters conceded that slavery did not provide an efficient supply of labor, and did discourage immigration, the growth of domestic markets, and economic diversification.

In 1782, Virginia provided for the private manumission of slaves, and Maryland and Delaware followed her lead. In the North where emancipation posed far fewer social and economic problems, every state from New Jersey to New England, either by enacting statutes or amending constitutions, either gradually or immediately put an end to the institution: Vermont in 1777, Pennsylvania in 1780, Massachusetts in 1783, Rhode Island and Connecticut in 1784, New York in 1799, and New Jersey in 1804. In 1787 the Confederation Congress approved the Northwest Ordinance that banned slavery north and west of the Ohio River. In 1807, the federal Congress voted to put an end to the international slave trade. In spite of these successes, Americans who believed that slavery was a dying institution were wrong. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 and the expansion of the market for raw cotton restored slavery’s economic vitality, and the expansion of the plantation system into the Southwest restored its political viability. Courageous southerners continued to criticize slavery until the end of the Antebellum period, but had even less success than their predecessors.

Congress received its first petition from African Americans in 1797, this one addressing a specific problem within North Carolina. The petition claimed that the Senate had been guilty of reenslaving individuals who had already been manumitted, and the petitioners had all been slaves there at one time.

They sought redress for abuses of the Fugitive Slave Law, for infractions of the Foreign Slave Trade Law, and asked that steps be taken toward emancipation. George Thatcher once again defended their right to petition. He said that the race of the petitioners “was entirely immaterial: they stated their suffering under a law of the United States, and that was argument enough for a respectful reference.” This time they met with more success: the House voted to refer the petition to a committee. This vote was taken over the objections of many Southerners, but they objected to the petitions, not the petitioners. By the end of that year it would become more difficult for African Americans to petition Congress, simply because the federal government moved from the abolitionist stronghold of Philadelphia to the Southern site of Washington, D.C.

The 18th century had been a brutal age, and many Americans saw slavery as part of the natural order. However, many others were coming to see the institution as particularly brutal and degrading, and were beginning to wonder how best to deal with it. Many believed that white society would never assimilate freed blacks, that blacks could never enjoy the rights and freedoms exercise by whites in the United States. Many feared the states would not protect them from abuse. James Madison praised the philanthropy that led his friend Edward Coles to transport his slaves to Illinois and free them. But he added: “I wish your philanthropy would compleat its object, by changing their colour as well as their legal condition. Without this they seem destined to privation of that moral rank and those social blessings, which give to freedom more than half its value.” Others were profoundly skeptical that blacks had the capacity for moral and intellectual growth, and they feared that they would become criminals and paupers. Almost all feared miscegenation. Almost all insisted that they leave the country after they were emancipated.

In 1788, the abolitionist William Thornton reported that James Madison had given it as his opinion “that Slavery is not likely to be ever abolished in the Southern states of America till an Asylum be provided to which the manumitted Blacks may be sent.” Thornton also reported that the free blacks whom he spoke with might consider colonization, but they were “unwilling to be subject to any nation of whites,” and they would only consider moving to Africa if they could “be an independent people.” Another eminent Quaker abolitionist, John Parrish, collaborated with some 55 members of the black population of Philadelphia to draft a petition proposing that Congress act to establish an African colony. That petition was drawn up around the mid-1790s, but for whatever reason it was abandoned.   Many of the earliest experimental colonies in Africa were in fact disasters, and some of the earliest rumors spread about them were even worse. If those initial reports of the colonies painted too dismal a picture, however, later propaganda efforts would more than make up for the error. The idyllic stories that were circulating in the early 1790s may have piqued the interest among some of the black population in Philadelphia to consider seeking colonization as a solution to the problem of slavery. By the middle of that decade, it was becoming clear that conditions in Africa were not propitious, and at the same time conditions for free blacks within some of the Northern states were improving. Colonization would never be widely embraced among the African American community.

Physical punishment, mutilation, and death threats proved to be effective weapons for slaveholders intent on coercing slaves into obedience and submission.

For blacks, the family unit had always been a critical part of the social fabric, in Africa as free persons and in America as slaves. One of the cruelest aspects of slavery was that families on the same plantation often were broken up when owners sold family members to different owners. Black mothers and fathers were traumatized by the sale of their children to distant and remote locations. Often, freed slaves would search for years to reunite with family members. Even for those slaves who were lucky enough to find their families and able to reunite with them, the scars of slavery could be everlasting.

Its real purpose was not the emancipation and colonization of slaves, but instead the expulsion of blacks who were already free, the elimination of the threat to slavery posed by men and women who were already free. Before 1830, however, some black leaders supported the A.C.S. because they believed a successful settlement in African would prove that blacks had the capacity to run a country. Before 1830 even Garrison supported colonization.  By the 1830s, however, Garrison and others were convinced that the primary obstacle to emancipation was the A.C.S. itself.

In 1831, Garrison announced these new tactics in the first issue of The Liberator. He promised that he would be “as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice.” He demanded immediate freedom for the slaves, and declared, “I do not wish to think, to speak, or to write with moderation… I will not equivocate; I will not excuse; I will not retreat a single inch; and I WILL BE HEARD.”  In 1833 in Philadelphia, Garrison, Theodore Dwight Weld, Arthur and Lewis Tappan, and a handful of other radicals founded the American Antislavery Society in Philadelphia. They demanded immediate emancipation, endorsed nonviolence, and adapted the tactic of “moral suasion” that had produced success for earlier reformers. The members went home to organize local societies, circulate tracts and petitions, give speeches, convert the most influential citizens of their communities, and through them the mass of God-fearing men and women to their cause.

They did convert individuals, even a few southerners like James G. Birney, and Sarah and Angelina Grimké. For the most part their efforts produced violent opposition. Mobs broke up their meetings, smashed their printing presses, burned down their buildings, and assaulted their members. In 1835 a mob put a noose around Garrison’s neck and dragged him through the streets of Boston. In 1837 in Alton, Illinois, another mob murdered abolitionist editor Elijah Lovejoy, burned down his home, and threw his printing press in the Mississippi River. In Washington, Congress adapted a Gag Rule that automatically tabled all abolitionist petitions, whether to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, or outlaw the interstate slave trade, or remove the Three-Fifths Clause from the Constitution, or refuse to admit new slave states to the Union. John Quincy Adams and a handful of allies violated the rule at every opportunity, broke the conspiracy of silence, and forced Congress to debate a topic it was trying desperately to avoid. Opposition to the rule transformed meddlesome fanatics into courageous champions of the First Amendment.

He condemned the Constitution as “a covenant with death and an agreement with hell” and refused to participate in politics. Moderates believed that political action was the most promising way to achieve success. In 1840 they formed the American and Foreign Antislavery Society. The movement split, but a decade of agitation had stirred up northern hostility toward the South and slavery. After 1840 the annexation of Texas, the war with Mexico, and the acquisition of new territory in the West guaranteed that the slavery question would dominate national politics until the war finally imposed a solution.
