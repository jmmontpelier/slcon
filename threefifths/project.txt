This simplistic account of the Three-Fifths Clause does not accurately reflect the debates surrounding the issue. The Framers did not base this compromise on any perceived inferiority of the personhood of the slave; indeed, it was the Southern slaveholding states that had wanted slaves to be counted equally with freemen (to increase Southern power in the Congress and, eventually, election of the president as well), and some Northern delegates had argued that slaves should not be counted at all for reasons of representation.

It was obvious to everyone that, however they were counted, slaves would of course have no vote; therefore, any increase in representation resulting from counting slaves would only benefit the slaveholders. Counting an enslaved population in order to increase the political clout of slaveholders was seen as an inversion of the principle of representation. Probably no one has ever described this problem more forcefully or more concisely than Pennsylvania’s Gouverneur Morris did in the Convention.  (Click on the image, right, to see Gouverneur Morris’ comments.)  Counting slaves in the census would give slaveowners a political bonus in the legislature and in the election of the president, and it would give them this political advantage on the basis of and in proportion to the number of people that they enslaved and oppressed. Such a basis for political representation had never been tried before (no state counted slaves for the purpose of representation in their own legislatures), and certain delegates from the Northern states wanted to exclude the slaves altogether from the apportionment of representation in the federal Constitution.

After all, taxation was always based on distinctions in wealth; therefore, it was fitting that political power—which also inevitably determined the taxes which would be levied on the states—should also be, at least in part, based on distinctions of wealth. Virginia and Pennsylvania had a similar number of free inhabitants, but Virginia also had nearly 300,000 enslaved inhabitants while Pennsylvania had only a few thousand. Was it fair, the reasoning went, to tax Virginia more than Pennsylvania on the basis of its superior wealth but to give the two states equal numbers of representatives? This consideration was even more compelling because Congress was not designed merely to represent individual citizens; it was also designed to represent state interests as such. Even those Convention delegates who were at some moments the loudest in proclaiming the justice of proportional representation—such as James Madison, Gouverneur Morris, James Wilson, and Rufus King—were willing at other moments to concede that the number of free inhabitants was not the only consideration worthy of factoring into the equation for representation.

General Pinckney from South Carolina could not agree more; he “dwelt on the superior wealth of the Southern States, and insisted on its having its due weight in the government.” In fact, there did not seem to be a single delegate who consistently argued that representation should be based on free population alone. The various proposals for representation that were offered in the Convention would have factored into the equation either the states, the money paid into the federal treasury, property in general, or slaves in particular. The main difficulty with the Three-Fifths Clause (for those members who perceived any difficulty at all) was the appearance of inflating the political power of slaveowners by counting (even partially) the numbers of those whom they oppressed. Many of these objects would probably have been removed if the Constitution had arrived at a similar balance of representation between the Northern and Southern states but had found a different means of achieving the same effect. Several other delegates would have been satisfied if other forms of property had been included rather than singling out slaves alone.

Finally, James Wilson of Pennsylvania and Charles Pinckney of South Carolina moved that, in the formation of the First House, representation would be based on “the whole number of white and other free citizens… and three fifths of all other persons” (in other words, slaves). Wilson and Pinckney did not dream up the three-fifths ratio on their own; there was precedence for that particular fraction. A few years earlier, Congress had proposed changing the way that money was requisitioned from the states. Instead of basing requisitions on the value of real estate (which was what the Articles of confederation had prescribed but which was increasingly seen as unworkable), Congress proposed basing requisitions on a similar ratio (it was Madison who had proposed the precise number). The proposed new mode of calculating requisitions had ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_125","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_125","title":"passed Congress and all but two of the state legislatures. Even though this amendment never went into effect, people had become accustomed to that fraction in relation to slavery. Consequently as Rufus King explained in the Massachusetts Ratifying Convention, the Framers adopted the fraction in the Constitution “because it was the language of all America.”  Nonetheless, counting slaves (in whole or in part) for the purpose of taxation is not the same thing as counting them for the purpose of representation. In fact, the decision to count the slave population as a fraction of free population was subtly anti-slavery in its implications because it is a tacit recognition that slave labor is less productive than free labor. The Southern states may have been wealthier than a census of their free population alone would calculate, but these states would be far wealthier still if all of their population was free. Even George Mason, who owned more slaves than almost anyone else in the room, did not regard the value of slave labor “as equal to freemen, and could not vote for them as such.” By selecting three-fifths as the ratio for counting slaves, the Convention therefore adopted a fraction that people in America would find familiar and acceptable. But the Framers were using that fraction for a different purpose than had originally been proposed for it, and that new purpose carried with it new implications.

The measure passed overwhelmingly (9-to-2). Elbridge Gerry was the only member who voiced any objection to the proposal. Immediately after this vote, Wilson and Hamilton even proposed to apply the same rule (which included the Three-Fifths Clause) to the representation in the second chamber of the legislature as well. This proposal was also passed, though by a much narrower margin (6-to-5). It is clear from the votes that those who objected to the new rule were opposed to proportional representation of any kind in the second chamber; they were not dissenting because they objected to the Three-Fifths Clause as such.  The delegates moved on to other matters, and the subject of the Three-Fifths Clause did not come before the Convention as a whole until almost a month later. When it did reemerge it immediately became embroiled and embedded in the more contentious question of whether the states should be represented proportionally or equally in the two houses. Furthermore, even if they could agree that Congress was meant to represent the states proportionally, should they count only population (setting aside the question of slave or free), or should they also include a reckoning of “property” in each state (a word which was sometimes used as a euphemism for slaves, but which often referred to property more generally). The controversy over the Three-Fifths Clause was continually muddied with these other issues, but many delegates became increasingly distressed over the appearance of favoring Southern slaveowners by counting slaves in the apportionment of representation.

Madison spoke of each region as requiring protection for the interests which were associated with having or not having slaves, but others spoke of the Three-Fifths Clause as a way to protect slavery itself. Edmund Randolph “urged strenuously that express security ought to be provided for including slaves in the ratio of Representation. He lamented that such a species of property existed. But as it did exist the holders of it would require this security.” Pierce Butler of South Carolina was more blunt: “The security the Southern states want is, that their negroes may not be taken from them, which some gentlemen within or without doors have a very good mind to do.” Virginians such as Randolph and Madison personally agonized over the evils of slavery; South Carolinians such as Butler tended to be more callous about the institution; but the members from these two states were united in their wish to keep the federal authorities from threatening their own state’s interests, especially after it became clear that voting in the Senate would not be proportioned to differences in population. Increasing the political leverage of Southern states in Congress was one way of providing a measure of security from federal encroachment (especially if Congress would otherwise be dominated by Northern interests.)

Perhaps because some of the Southerners were overreaching, a few members from the North began to express misgivings about any inclusion of slaves in the apportionment of representation. Gouverneur Morris was especially virulent against any inclusion of slaves in the rule for representation, particularly since no other form of property was included. He said he was “reduced to the dilemma of doing injustice to the Southern states, or to human nature, and he must therefore do it to the former; for he could never agree to give such encouragement to the slave trade as would be given by allowing them a representation for their negroes.” It was bad enough that the Deep South would be permitted to continue importing slaves; it was obscene that they would be rewarded with more political power for every new slave they imported.

On July 12 he suggested adding to the clause relating to the rule of representation “a proviso, ‘that taxation shall be in proportion to representation.’” In all likelihood, Morris’ suggestion was intended merely to cool the ardor of the Southern states for gaining greater representation based on slave property. If this was the case, then his stratagem failed miserably. Three Southerners in quick succession admitted the justice of Morris’ attempt to tie representation to taxation, and the South Carolinians immediately tried against to count slaves as equal to freemen.

After this mild subterfuge was incorporated into the proposal on July 12, it passed the deeply divided Convention: six states voting aye, two voting no, and two states divided. By the last week of the Convention, however, Wilson must have forgotten the purpose of his own handiwork. He moved to sunder the two provisions of taxation and representation in Article I, Section 2, since it seemingly made no sense to have a clause about taxation within a section that dealt only with representation.

That standard of apportionment, however, was from being the only perspective among those who considered the question of apportionment in 1787 and 1788, and this was true regardless of which region was debating the question.

After the election of 1800, Jefferson’s detractors called him the “Negro President” because he could not have won his election against John Adams without the extra Electoral College votes awarded to states with large slave populations. And during the crisis over the Missouri Compromise, Northerners, including Rufus King, who was then a senator, tried to prevent the three-fifths rule for apportionment from being applied to the new slave states in the West.  If some Northerners would later accuse the Southerners of wrenching a concession from them that would unfairly inflate the South’s political importance, disgruntled Southerners would accuse the North of the same thing. Charles Pinckney, who had fought unsuccessfully to have slaves counted fully for representation, resented later attempts by Northern delegates to weaken the effects of the Three-Fifths Clause by stopping its spread into the new states. In a speech before the House of Representatives, he argued in 1821 that the Northern states ought “to be highly pleased with their present situation; that they are fully represented, while we have lost great a share of our representation; they ought, sir, to be highly pleased at the dexterity and management of their members in the Convention, who obtained for them this great advantage.” Each side would argue that the other side had gotten more than its fair share of representation—typically a sign of a real compromise.
