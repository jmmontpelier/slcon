The amendment would get nowhere in the Senate, however, which had a majority sympathetic to the Southern position. For a time, neither chamber was willing to compromise, and Congress adjourned in 1819 with Missouri’s fate undecided.

David Morril, a senator from New Hampshire, argued that the Constitution’s 20-year Compromise gave Congress the power to restrict the movement of slavery into the new states. That clause read: “The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight…” Morril argued:   Congress have, by the letter and the spirit of the Constitution, a right not only to prohibit the importation of slaves into this country, but also their migration into any State or territory, except those within the jurisdiction of the original States, which admitted slavery at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.  He went further. Not only did the Constitution permit Congress to take this action, but its Framers clearly intended that they would pursue that course. Their intentions were also made clear in the 20-year compromise: “Does it not appear, from the words of that instrument, it was their intention to arrest the progress and prevent the further extension of involuntary servitude?” If, then, “the framers of the Constitution viewed slavery an evil, (a fact of which we cannot doubt),” and they intended by the Constitution to arrest the progress of slavery, then the prohibition of slavery in Missouri was comfortable to both the spirit and the letter of the law.

Since Thomas Jefferson’s victory in 1801, an alliance of South and West based on agricultural interests had dominated American politics. It elected presidents, controlled Congress, and determined policy. The North and East blamed their impotence on the Three-Fifths Clause, and were determined that it would not increase a new state’s representation in Congress and the Electoral College. Senator Jonathan Roberts from Pennsylvania argued that, should Missouri be admitted without first requiring emancipation, then it would benefit “the slaveholding interest, pecuniarily and economically. The scale of political power will preponderate in favor of the slaveholding States.” Northerners may have hoped to exploit opposition to slavery to create a new dominant coalition of North and West. For some, opposition to slavery was undoubtedly sincere, but it was also a useful wedge issue. When Maine applied for statehood at the end of 1819, it provided a pretext, if not a rationale, for resolving the impasse. In 1820, the House passed the Maine Bill, which simply accepted Maine’s application to join the Union as a state. The Senate added a rider to the Maine Bill that enabled Missouri to form a government without restriction, and Jesse Thomas added an amendment—meant as a sweetener—that prohibited slavery in the Louisiana Purchase north of 36°30’ (which happened to be the southern border of Missouri). It admitted Maine as a free state, allowed Missouri to permit slavery in its constitution, left Arkansas open to slavery, and barred slavery form the rest of the Louisiana Purchase. The House voted 90-to-87 to allow slavery in Missouri and 134-to-42 to prohibit slavery in the northern half of the Louisiana Territory.

John Quincy Adams wondered if it might not have been better, all things considered, to let them go. Both sides seemed to think that if the North had maintained a hard line, a sectional rupture would have been the consequence.  Adams had supported the Missouri Compromise at the time, but he also questioned whether the Union was worth the capitulation.

Admission would upset the balance of free and slave states in the Senate and deprive the South of its most effective means of defeating legislation that threatened its interests. The debate was long and bitter, but in the end Henry Clay and Stephen Douglas maneuvered through the Congress a series of measures that satisfied moderates of both the North and South, measures they hoped would provide permanent solutions for all of the problems that threatened to destroy the Union.

It was dedicated to the proposition that there should be no more new slave states within the Union, and by the late 1850s, they had the political power to back up their position. The Southern states recognized this threat for the menace that it was. If the number of free states increased while the number of slave states remained the same—and if at the same time the population growth of free persons in the North continued to eclipse those in the South—then their fate was sealed. The political interests of the Southern states (especially their interests in slavery, but not only slavery) would represent a permanent minority within Congress. The very existence of slavery might be in jeopardy if the free states reached the threshold proportion of three-fourths. In that case, they could and probably would amend the Constitution: giving to Congress the power to emancipate slaves within the states.
