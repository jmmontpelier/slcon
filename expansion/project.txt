Constitution had become the law of the land, the Confederation Congress was forced to confront the question of regulating slavery in the federal territories that lay outside of any state jurisdiction. In 1784, Thomas Jefferson had tried to pass an ordinance that would have forbidden slavery in all of the Western territories, north and south, by the year 1800. He lost that battle by one vote. Even if it had passed, it is unclear whether it could have been enforced in the face of Southern opposition. The Southwestern territories had been ceded by the Southern states, and many in the South took umbrage at any attempts to deny them usage of that land unless they forsook their slavery property. The only practical consequence of Jefferson’s first attempts to forbid slavery in all of the territories was North Carolina’s subsequent decision to revoke its original land cession, taking back land that it had originally ceded to the confederacy. When North Carolina ceded the territory again in 1789, it stipulated that Congress could do nothing to emancipate slaves in those territories.  Jefferson’s original proposal met with partial success in 1787. That summer, the Confederation Congress passed the celebrated Northwest Ordinance, which prohibited slavery in the territories north of Virginia and west of Pennsylvania. This decision would become crucial for developing the North into a regional block that uniformly opposed Southern proslavery forces. Although the North had never been the slavery stronghold that the South had become, it was by no means a foregone conclusion that slavery would have been outlawed in all of those new Northern states if matters had been allowed to take their natural course. Almost as important, the Northwest Ordinance established an important precedent: that Congress could enact antislavery policies in nascent territorial governments.

People at the time may have believed that the question of slavery in the territories had been essentially resolved by 1787, and there was nothing left to settle. The Constitution allowed Congress to “make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States” (Art. IV, Sec. 3). And before the new Congress had been adopted, the old Congress had already settled that the Northwestern territories would be free of slavery, and the Southwestern territories would (presumably) be open to slaveholders.  That presumption was formally recognized in the less celebrated Southwestern Ordinance of 1790, which explicitly accepted the terms of the North Carolina cession, barring Congress form doing anything in those territories to emancipate slaves. Even apart from the ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_119","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_119","title":"limitations imposed by North Carolina, the Southwestern Ordinance reflected basic political realities of the time, both regional and federal. The new Constitution granted the new government authority (on paper, at least) to make territorial rules and regulations; however, for all practical purposes, the new government still lacked the manpower to enforce a ban on slavery in the Southern territories, even if had mustered the will to try. It would not even be an easy task to keep slavery out of the Northwestern territories, and it would have been impossible without some strong support arising naturally from within those territories.  Once the two ordinances were passed, all lands in federal possession were designated either slave or free, and there could appear to be little left for the new government to do on this question. What the Framers of the Constitution could not have foreseen, however, was the eventually acquisition of the Louisiana Territory in 1803, followed by Texas, the Oregon Territory, and the Mexican cession. Each new accretion of land reopened the increasingly contentious question of whether Congress had the power to forbid slavery in that territory, and whether they should exercise the power even if it was constitutional.

During the debates over the Louisiana territory, most of the Northern representatives asserted the constitutional right to limit slavery in the territories, and most of the Southern representatives denied that right, although there were defections from both sides and gradations among their members. The Southern states had not yet formed a solid voting block on every question related to slavery.  The congressmen from the Northern states were divided in their arguments no less than in their goals. One senator from New York, James Hillhouse, went so far as to propose a gradual emancipation plan that would have extended throughout the entire Louisiana Territory. The South was united in their opposition to this measure, and few Northerners joined their ranks to muster a 17-to-11 defeat of that proposal. The greater part of the debates in both houses, however, centered on the question of whether Congress had the power to prohibit slavery in the territories. For those who argued that Congress indubitably possessed this power, the Northwest Ordinance provided a compelling precedent showing that Congress did have this power and had in fact already exercised it. The Confederation Congress had adopted the clause banning slavery in those territories in 1787, and the First Congress had affirmed that power by adapting the Northwest Ordinance to the new Constitution in 1789. If the Southern states now wished to deny that power they would have to explain away the very first congressional act exercising federal authority over its own territories.

One member from Georgia pointed out that the old Congress had never possessed this authority under the Articles of Confederation: “no power to pass any such restriction having been delegated to Congress by that instrument; and all powers not expressly delegated being retained to the people.” In point of fact, this was true. The Articles of Confederation, unlike the Constitution, had not empowered Congress to make any rule or regulations for federal territories. Alexander Smyth of Virginia agreed, and he added a higher principle to his charge of congressional usurpation: “It was an act of illegitimate power; and it cannot bind those who are the source of all legitimate power.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_126","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_126","title":"For Smyth, the greater transgression did not lie with the initial prohibition of slavery in the territories, but the presumed power of Congress to pass a law that would be perpetually binding on “any portion of the people and their descendants forever.” His colleague from Virginia, Philip Barbour, agreed that the Ordinance was “utterly void,” but only because it had been passed by the old Congress. The present Congress did have the power to prohibit slaves in the territories—it could even emancipate them, for “over them we possess the whole power of municipal legislation”—but Congress could not insist upon either prohibition or emancipation as a condition for admitting the territory as a new state. Several members from the Southern states at this time were willing to consider federal legislation prohibiting slavery with federal territories, but only so long as the prohibition did not rest on the presumed legitimacy of the Northwest Ordinance, because the Ordinance had extended those prohibitions to the new states that were formed out of that territory.

John Sergeant of Pennsylvania pointed out that the Constitution had been framed during the same summer that the Northwest Ordinance passed. If the Framers of the Constitution had meant to leave every inhabitant of the territories free to answer this question, he argued, then it would have been addressed in the Constitution. It simply defied belief that the Framers had intended to take away the same power from the New Congress “and yet have said nothing about it, but conferred without limitation the very power to which it had become an established incident.” More than that, however, Sergeant rejected the underlying principle behind the Southerners’ arguments: “that there is a silent, dormant principle in the Constitution; a sullen power, that forbids us to check the extension of slavery.” He said he revolted from such a conclusion.

Smyth argued that the Constitution’s words granting the power to “make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territories” related to “property only, not to power over persons.” Echoing the later Dred Scott decision, there were suggestions that a federal ban on the free transport of one’s property violated the Due Process Clause of the 5th Amendment. Some Southerners refrained from attempting any consistent constitutional rationale for their position; they simply threatened to secede if their understanding of the Constitution did not hold sway.  The final compromise sought to secure amity rather than establish any durable principle about slavery’s future in the country. With the exception of Missouri, which was to be admitted as a slave state, the compromise prohibited slavery in the Louisiana Territory north of the 36°30’ latitude line. For all of the noisy bombast aimed at rejecting any congressional power to prohibit slavery in the territory, almost all of the Southern representatives seemed to approve of the arrangement.

The Louisiana Territory, it is true, had been divided with minimal conflict. The fate of Texas and Oregon were similarly settled with some trucking and bargaining between the regional interests, but the warring factions had become very obstreperous. In fact, when the question of annexing Texas was debated, some opponents of slavery, including John Quincy Adams, expressed a preference for letting Britain acquire the territory rather than America, because the British would have retained the land as a free state. But the lands acquired by the Mexican cession were destined to rouse the most dangerous partisan rancor yet. In 1846 David Wilmot introduced into the Congress a proviso that barred slavery from territory acquired from Mexico. The proviso repeatedly passed in the House and just as repeatedly failed in the Senate, and provoked a confrontation that came close to breaking up the Union a decade before the South fired upon Fort Sumter.

In 1854 the dispute over slavery and the territories became hopelessly entangled in the efforts of Douglas and others to construct a railroad linking the Mississippi River and the Pacific Ocean. Douglas was determined to make Chicago the eastern terminal. Before it could begin construction, the Congress had to organize the territory through which the railroad would run. Southerners led by Senator David Atchison of Kansas made it clear that they would never vote to organize an area closed to slavery by the Missouri Compromise. They forced Douglas to amend the bill to declare that the compromise was “inoperable” and “void.”  That agreement set off a storm of protest led by Charles Sumner and Salmon Chase. Free Soil congressmen denounced the measure as “a gross violation of a sacred pledge, a criminal betrayal of precious rights, part and parcel of an atrocious plot” to make the territory “a region of despotism.” The battle in Congress consumed almost six months. Douglas in the Senate and Alexander H. Stevens in the House pushed the Kansas-Nebraska Act through by narrow margins, and Franklin Pierce signed the bill into law. It was an appalling mistake. It organized governments for Kansas and Nebraska, but it split the Democratic Party into hostile factions, destroyed the Whig Party, and called the Republican Party into existence. It also badly damaged the career of one politician (Douglas, who wrongly believed that Popular Sovereignty would bring about the peaceful settlement of the West) and rejuvenated the political career of another (Abraham Lincoln, whose 1858 debates with Douglas made him a hero of the Free Soil North).

Two days before the Dred Scott decision was handed down, Buchanan prepared the public mind to accept its verdict, whatever it might be. Congress had already applied the “happy conception” of allowing the people within each territory to decide whether or not slavery would be allowed in their midst, he said. As for any other detail relating to this matter, “it is a judicial question, which legitimately belongs to the Supreme Court of the United States, before whom it is now pending, and will, it is understood, be speedily and finally settled. To their decision, in common with all good citizens, I shall cheerfully submit, whatever this may be.”  Buchanan and the other advocates for compromise had hoped that the Court’s decision would finally end the agitation of the abolitionists and soothe the sectional tensions between North and South. They could not be more wrong. What had initially seemed like a ploy to defuse the sectional conflict had the opposite effect. The Northern states refused to accept that the highest court in the land should have the last word on this question. And the Republican Party, which had been largely founded on the platform of containing slavery, surged ahead of the competing parties. It may be an exaggeration to say that the Dred Scott decision brought on the Civil, but it unquestionably released the levers that catapulted a relatively green politician, Abraham Lincoln, into the highest office of the land.

The finality of their verdict extended no further than the individual facts of the case. Clarifying this distinction, Lincoln insisted: “We do not propose that when Dred Scott has been decided to be a slave by the court, we, as a mob, will decide him to be free.” But he refused to be bound by the “political rule” set down by a few unelected men. Final authority for deciding the nation’s political rules was for Congress, the president, and ultimately the voters to decide. Lincoln continued:   We do not propose to be bound by it as a political rule in that way, because we think it lays the foundation not merely for enlarging and spreading out what we consider an evil, but it lays the foundation for spreading that evil into the States themselves. We propose so resisting it as to have it reversed if we can, and a new judicial rule established upon this subject.  In another speech, he made this political resistance to judicial authority even more clear: “If I were in Congress, and a vote should come up on a question whether slavery should be prohibited in a new territory, in spite of that Dred Scott decision, I would vote that it should.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_97","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_97","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18769","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18794","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_98","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_98","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18848","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si18873","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_202","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_202","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide16327","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Resistance to the Political Rule of Unelected Men","thumbnail":"dr/Slide16327_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si16361","si16363","Text_Caption_161","Image_130","Text_Caption_162","btn_previous_97","si18769","si18794","btn_next_98","si18848","si18873","Image_202"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide16327"}}},{"id":"si16443","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_131","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_131","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_132","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_132","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_54","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_54","title":"The Expansion of Slavery into the Territories ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_40","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_40","title":"The Lincoln-Douglas Debates ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_163","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_163","title":"The Will of the Majority ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_164","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_164","title":"Ultimately, Lincoln was elected president on his avowed determination to resist the principles laid down in the Dred Scott decision.

One of his earliest acts was to reverse the previous administration’s decision to deny particular citizenship rights to two free black individuals (a passport and a patent, respectively).  He intended to follow the same course of action with regard to slavery in the territories. As he explained in his First Inaugural, the Constitution had not expressly stated whether Congress could or could not outlaw slavery in the territories. Where the Constitution was silent or unclear, it was the prerogative of the majority to decide and it was the duty of the minority to submit. With Lincoln’s election, the majority had decided in favor of prohibiting the extension of slavery into the territories. It was now the duty of Southerners to submit to the will of the majority.
