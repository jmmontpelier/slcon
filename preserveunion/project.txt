the popular imagination so strong that even the most zealous historians have not been able to destroy it: he was a poor and humble rail-splitter from the backwoods of the American West. He was unschooled. He was the prototypical common man. Through his own efforts alone he rose to the  presidency of the United States and did mighty deeds: he  freed the slaves and saved the Union. He brooded over the  sins of the nation, counseled “malice toward none” and  “charity for all,” died, and became a martyr and a national  monument. This not-entirely-serious description contains more than a grain of truth which accounts for its longevity.  A few historians have portrayed a very different Lincoln. For them he was a racist and a white supremacist. That description also contains a grain of truth. The real Lincoln was neither an angel nor a demon.

The myth insists that Lincoln was able to overcome that environment and become an opponent of slavery and a champion of emancipation. He may have been a member of a crew of a flat boat that carried corn and pork down the Mississippi to New Orleans. There he may have visited a slave market and sworn, “by God, boys…if I ever get a chance to hit that thing, I’ll hit it hard.” But the story was probably the invention of William Herndon, Lincoln’s law partner, who very much wanted it to be true.

Despite Lincoln’s attempts to amend and then defeat the resolutions, they easily passed the state’s House and Senate. Six weeks later Lincoln introduced resolutions of protest against the ones that had previously passed. His resolutions declared: “The institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy; but…the promulgation of abolition doctrine tends rather to increase than to abate its evils.” He found only one member willing to join him in this protest. Slavery was wrong, in Lincoln’s view, but stirring up agitation in pursuit of its abolition could also be wrong. Lincoln once claimed that he had “always hated slavery … as much as an abolitionist,” but ever the pragmatist, he could not approve of all of the abolitionists’ methods. Besides, it would have been political suicide to openly side with them.

Most of his cases related to railroads: charters, rights of way, taxation. But in 1847 he represented Robert Matson, a Kentuckian trying to recover a slave mother and her children. Lincoln knew that slavery was legal in the state, believed that even slaveowners had a right to competent counsel, and perhaps hoped that slavery would die out if it could not expand into the territories.  In 1849, near the end of his single term in Congress, notable only for his introduction of the “Spot Resolution,” he introduced a bill that provided for gradual compensated emancipation in the District of Columbia. It freed children born after 1850, but only if “the free white male citizens of the city” approved. To increase support for the bill, he added a clause that required officials to arrest fugitives and return them to their owners. It was this clause that led Wendell Phillips to brand Lincoln “the slave-hound of Illinois.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_73","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_73","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si16950","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si16975","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_74","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_74","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17029","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17054","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_143","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_143","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_165","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_165","title":"A Bill to Abolish Slavery in the District of Columbia ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_144","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_144","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_110","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_110","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20028","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20060","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_216","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_216","title":"Slave Traders, Alexandria, VA.

The Republican Party succeeded, as the Native American Party did not, because it organized only in the free states and so had no need to compromise with Southern demands for a territorial slave code. And because it avoided the error committed by the Liberty Party whose platform in 1840 and 1844 focused entirely on emancipation, and the Free Soil Party which in 1848 focused only on the exclusion of blacks, free or slave, from the West.  Instead, the Republican Party made itself the champion of an expanded role for the federal government in the development of the economy, advocating a tariff to protect American manufactures, increased appropriations for internal improvements, distribution to farmers of public land in the West, and restoration of a national bank. And because it opposed the expansion of slavery into the West (but did not propose to abolish slavery itself, which they knew the Constitution protected in the states), and because it largely avoided the anti-Catholic bigotry of the Know Nothings, it avoided many of the pitfalls that other parties fell into. Republicans benefited enormously from the howls of rage provoked by Chief Justice Roger Taney’s infamous decision in Scott v. Sandford, his ruling that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional, and that blacks had no rights that whites were obligated to respect.

He insisted repeatedly that “slavery is a monstrous wrong … if slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.” But he went out of his way not to blame the Southern people: “They are just what we would be in their situation. If slavery did not now exist amongst them, they would not introduce it. If it did exist amongst us, we would not easily give it up.” He admitted that he did not know how to abolish it: “If all earthly power were given to me, I should not know what to do.”  In politics, Lincoln faced a seemingly impossible problem. He had to campaign for votes in a state in which many voters believed that slavery was morally wrong, most voters believed that blacks were inferior, and almost all voters wanted to ban blacks from the state. It was not slavery they rejected strenuously; it was the presence of blacks. He unveiled his solution during the debates with Stephen Douglas. He did not attack slavery in the states where it already existed, but he did insist it must not spread into the Western territories. His solution to the problem did not produce victory in his campaign for the Senate, but it may have contributed to his victory in the campaign for the presidency in 1860.

I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.…” But Lincoln did promise to preserve the Union. (Click on the top-left image.)  Next Lincoln identified the institution that was driving the sections apart: “One section of our country believes slavery is right, and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be extended.” And finally he begged the seceded states not to provoke a war. (Click on the bottom-left image.)  In the interests of peace and harmony, Lincoln was willing to make a number of concessions to the Southern states if they would return to the fold, but there were also a couple of points on which he remained firm:   First, he maintained that the states did not possess any “right” to secede from the Union.  Second, he maintained that his election to the presidency had demonstrated that the majority had voted to limit the spread of slavery into the territories. Within republican forms of government, the will of the majority must prevail and it was the duty of the minority to submit.

Acting upon this understanding, the states immediately established the Articles of Confederation and then the Constitution.  Although Lincoln canvassed American history to show that the states did not possess the sovereign authority to depart from the Union, he insisted that the issue was an important one for all free governments:   ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_83","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_83","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17740","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17765","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_84","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_84","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17819","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17844","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_213","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_213","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_219","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_219","title":"“Inherent and fatal weakness” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Slide15364","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Lincoln argues against the \"right\" of secession","thumbnail":"dr/Slide15364_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si25244","Text_Caption_130","btn_previous_83","si17740","si17765","btn_next_84","si17819","si17844","Image_213","Text_Caption_219"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide15364"}}},{"id":"si15483","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si15485","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_44","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_44","title":"A War to Preserve the Union ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_30","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_30","title":"Lincoln Argues Against the “Right” of Secession ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_131","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_131","title":"The Survival of Republican Government ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_132","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_132","title":"To Lincoln, the constitutional question could be reduced to two sub-questions:   Could any republican government be strong enough during moments when they were under attack to survive the encounter?

Congress concurred and in July 1861 approved resolutions introduced by John J Crittenden and Andrew Johnson that affirmed that the United States had no intention to “overthrow or interfere with the rights or established institutions of the states,” but only to “defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several states unimpaired.”  Most Republicans changed their minds, but in July, even radicals who believed that the war would destroy slavery voted for the resolutions.

Lincoln sent the proposed amendment to the states anyway in a last-ditch effort to avoid war. The amendment made clear that the federal government had no authority to interfere with slavery in the states where it already existed (a position that had been the predominant opinion since the Constitution was adopted, and one with which Lincoln agreed). But the amendment went further. It also promised that no future amendment would ever be adopted allowing Congress to interfere with slavery. If it had been ratified, then it would have become the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, and it would have made impossible the 13th Amendment that eventually came to pass. Lincoln did everything he reasonably could do to assure the seceding states that slavery in the states was not in danger, but he still refused to allow the institution to expand into the territories. For the Southern states, none of Lincoln’s overtures were enough. And so secession and war came.

Lincoln had unilaterally exercised some powers, such as calling forth an army and suspending habeas corpus, that were legislative powers. By so doing, he had violated the separation of powers that the Constitution sought to maintain. Lincoln attempted to explain and justify the measures he took in a special session of Congress (and he was careful to note that the president was “authorized by the Constitution to convene this special session) on July 4, 1861. To defend his actions, Lincoln appealed to what he called “a popular demand and a public necessity.” The exigency of the circumstances called forth these actions, and the people had approved.  Nevertheless, the suspension of habeas corpus—the “Great Writ”—was a particularly troubling power for the executive branch to exercise, because that action seemed to threaten the people’s most fundamental individual liberties. The Constitution allows Congress to suspend the privilege “when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” Therefore the particular circumstances of 1861—the open rebellion in the South—might have justified its suspension, but it did not necessarily justify the president in making that call without the directive of the legislature. The difference between such an action being taken by Congress and the same action being taken by the president is the difference between the rule of the law and a rule by executive fiat. Lincoln did not expect people to accept his actions without a murmur of protest, nor did he believe that they should.

And furthermore, those cases where “the public safety may require it,” as spelled out by the Constitution, might for the same causes be an occasion when Congress was prevented from meeting. In such a case, the president would have to act alone. Even more important, he explained that the rule of law and the Constitution were themselves in jeopardy, and a suspension of one part of the law was necessary for preserving the rest. He asked: “are all the laws but one to get unexecuted and the Government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated?”  Lincoln thus established a paradox that would be a recurring theme throughout the war. A battle that was ostensibly waged to preserve the Constitution would sometimes require its violation in order to be won. Lincoln would later use the analogy of a doctor who amputates a limb in order to save the patient’s life.

To give Lincoln’s argument a modern twist: nobody would consent to subjecting their body to chemotherapy unless they had a life-threatening cancer.

Once the patient returned to health, the strong medicines must be abandoned.

Some newspapers were closed down and editors arrested when they attacked the war efforts. While many of the most egregious abridgments to the freedom of the press were carried out by generals (or mobs) who were not acting under the direction of the president, Lincoln did sanction the curtailment of the press when he believed it was inciting desertion among his soldiers. And whereas Lincoln had defended the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus only out of military necessity, others were suspending the privilege for non-military purposes. Once the Chief Magistrate begins to bend the laws, his subordinates are not always going to grasp the finer points of military necessity that are meant to justify the measures.  As the war dragged on, Lincoln’s beliefs about what justified extra-constitutional action became even sharper. In his First Inaugural, he had appealed to both “a popular demand and a public necessity” for his actions, but he soon came to believe that only necessity could justify extra-constitutional action, and popular demand never could. When one of his generals had resorted to martial law in Norfolk, Virginia, he justified the decision by first obtaining the public’s acquiescence through a popular election. Lincoln would have preferred that the general had taken full responsibility for the measure on his own shoulders. “Nothing justifies the suspending of the civil by the military authority, and not a popular vote, is to decide.” During times of crisis, the public may be only too ready to suspend constitutional protections. Some greater measure of legitimacy was needed.

As soon as Federal armies occupied Confederate territory, slaves had began escaping into their lines. In May 1861, three slaves reached Fortress Monroe. Their owner demanded their return, but Benjamin F. Butler (an incompetent general, but an imaginative lawyer) declared the men “contraband,” confiscated them, and put them to work for the Union. Were they free? Nobody knew. In August 1861, John C. Frémont, Commanding General of the Department of the West, declared the slaves in his department free. And in May 1862, David Hunter, Commanding General of the Department of the South, freed the slaves in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Lincoln was trying desperately to keep the border states in the Union, revoked both orders, and removed Frémont (but not Hunter) from command.

Horace Greeley censured the president’s apparent apathy in an editorial written as an open letter titled, “The Prayer of the Twenty Millions.” He complained: “We think you are strangely and disastrously remiss in the discharge of your official and imperative duty with regard to the emancipating provisions of the new Confiscation Act. Those provisions were designed to fight Slavery with Liberty.” In conclusion, Greeley numbered himself among those who would have gladly avoided the war.

In this letter to Greeley, Lincoln described what he believed was his “official duty,” but he also repeated his “personal wish that all men every where could be free.” As president, he could only authorize what was within the scope of his official powers, and at this time he believed there were constitutional and political reasons preventing a general emancipation of the slaves.

Frémont’s proclamation was “simply ‘dictatorship.’” Lincoln had no doubt that these dictatorial measures would be “more popular” with some thoughtless and reckless people, but Lincoln did not take what was popular as his guided to action. Indeed, his revocation of Frémont’s proclamation may have been the most unpopular choice in that first year of the war.

On this question, Lincoln’s thinking may have evolved. As he had told the general who exercised martial law in Norfolk: If military necessity was the only plea on which extra-constitutional action could be justified, then members of the military—especially the Commander-in Chief—were uniquely qualified to judge whether an action were truly a military necessity. As the political branch, Congress might not be qualified to judge military necessity.

He saw that the proclamation’s limited emancipation “was popular in some quarters, and would have been more so if it had been a general declaration of emancipation.” Nonetheless, it was not popular in Kentucky, and Lincoln needed that state: “I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.” Not only did Frémont fail to justify his measure as a military necessity, but his rash actions might even have cost them the war. Still, the president insisted that he had revoked Frémont’s orders even before he had heard from Kentucky; his choice would have been the same if there were no political limitations to consider.  Lincoln was unsympathetic to the arguments of the abolitionists. By late 1861 he was moving away from his initial reluctance to act against slavery, but he faced an impossible dilemma: how to remove the cause of the war and keep England out of the war and suppress the rebellion and still retain the loyalty of Democrats in the North. In March 1862 he proposed to Congress a plan for gradual, compensated emancipation and colonization. The border states would voluntarily free their slaves over 30 years; the federal government would compensate the owners and encourage the freedmen to settle outside of the United States. He knew that without colonization, most Northerners would not accept emancipation, even if it were carried out by the states. Beginning in early 1862, every time Lincoln proposed a new move against slavery, he made a great fuss about colonization. Late in 1862 he convinced Congress to fund two colonies, one in New Granada (now Panama), one on Ile a Vache (near Haiti). Both failed, in part because the border states refused to cooperate. They forced Lincoln to concede that voluntary emancipation was impossible.

During the first half of 1862, Congress approved emancipation in the District of Columbia, abolished slavery in the territories, and passed the Second Confiscating Act and the Militia Act, authorizing the president to enlist \"persons of African descent\" for \"any service for which they might be found competent.\" In September Lincoln published the preliminary emancipation proclamation and at least three generals began to enlist black troops. Military defeats had undermined morale and reduced the willingness of whites to enlist, and conscription provoked violent opposition.

There were only 46,000 military-age black men in the entire Union. The economy was booming, and the war had created unprecedented opportunities for blacks. Confederate officials had announced that they would not treat captured black soldiers as prisoners of war. Lincoln threatened to shoot a Confederate prisoner for every black soldier or white officer of a black unit that Confederates executed. The North never carried out the threat, but the South did. The most infamous massacre occurred at Fort Pillow where troops under the command of Nathanial Bedford Forrest shot down \"several dozen\" blacks after they had surrendered. And at Battery Wagner in Charleston Harbor, Confederates refused to accept the surrender of black troops. Lesser known massacres occurred at Poison Spring, Arkansas; Milliken's Bend and Port Hudson, Louisiana; and Saltville, Virginia.  The Union Army undermined efforts to recruit blacks by its treatment of men who did enlist. It was reluctant to commission black officers or to grant black troops equal pay. Congress did not remedy that injustice until January 1864. Most of the black men who did enlist, voluntarily or not, came from the South. In all, about 186,000 served in the Union army, about 10,000 more in the navy, and an unknown number of civilian cooks, teamsters, servants, and laborers. In all, the Union mustered in 16 all-black regiments and one all-black corps. One hundred and nine served as officers, mostly doctors and chaplains. Blacks fought in 39 major battles, suffered 36,000 casualties, won 17 Medals of Honor, and contributed immeasurably to Union victory.
